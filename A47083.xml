            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And not to be allowed the liberty of eyes, and underſtanding, or private judgment, to diſcerne between right or wrong Leaders, which is of ſuch temporal concern and preſervation to every man in this World; nor between the will of God, and his Creature, where they interfere, which is of ſuch Eternal moment in the other, (wherein lyes the Radical errour of ſome Modern Christian Heatheniſm,) were to be depos'd from being men any more, or reduc'd to an Eternal <hi>non-age</hi> and inability, to diſcern between good and evil, and fitter therefore to be governed, than to govern ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves, or others.</p>
            <p>Having therefore, for the establiſhment of Friends, and the comfort of Regular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Irregular, and ſeduc'd ſufferers for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, bestowed endeavours, to distinguiſh the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of Divine and Human Soveraignty, whereon the Peace of Communities, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls depends, (being as manifestly distinguiſhable, as Heaven and Earth, or Soul and Body,) and stated alſo, and evinc'd the Title of <hi>Right Mother-Church,</hi> to our own <hi>Brittain;</hi> (though its known, a Harlot can bid fair for a true Mother, where ſhe lights not on <hi>Solomons</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:41014:4"/>
Judges, and where ſhe does, be willing the Child be divided into Sects, and parcells, which ſhe is not like to enjoy to her ſelf entire,) and ſufficiently demonſtrated, (to any whoſe invincible minds and Spirits are unreduc'd from their Loyalty to God and truth,) That Popery, in its Leaders, is an uniform invaſion, and in its followers; a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſobedience to right Soveraigns, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and Proteſtancy in its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be ſafe and clear from ſuch diſorders;</p>
            <p>I judg'd fit to dedicate the Argument, to whom it was duty to preſent the firſt Copy; to your Royal Highneſs, my Gracious Prince, and Maſter, having afore-hand weighed and conſider'd, (as I ought,) it would make for your Highneſs Honour, and publick love, either at <hi>home,</hi> or <hi>abroad,</hi> in the disjunctive, whatever were its reſentment, or ſucceſs: At <hi>home,</hi> with God and the Countrey, if it ſerv'd in the leaſt to fortifie your Royal Breaſt againſt temptations, or at leaſt with <hi>Forreign</hi> Lords of Celeſtial Crowns, and Canonizations, againſt whoſe Sacred Avarice, and Catholick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for Tribute and ſubjection, and other Politick Arts, which are not unknown, and infallible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Idolatries, which are not unconfuted, ſuch plain and manifeſt Truths, from clean hands and ends, could ſo little prevail; though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the ſenſe of the whole Nation, and the rights of this ancient Apoſtolical Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>Senior,</hi> if not <hi>Mother</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41014:4"/>Withall, the Subject being of the Heart, and Conſcience, and comprizing, as the heart doth, in a narrow Room, a competent ſtock of Divine Rules, and meaſures, to judge of Truth, (and about Church matters,) ſeem'd therefore the fitter preſent for a Prince, ſo nigh to Soveraign, who is a Nation contracted in one man.</p>
            <p>And Princes, like God whom they repreſent, delight in hearts: And no Prince in Story was ever the <hi>Darling</hi> of more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hearts, than your R. H. and ſtrange and unjuſt it were, you ſhould ſuffer any abatement of that Glory, for no other reaſon, but your exalted ſuperlative zeal for God, and your Conſcience, above Crowns or Kingdoms, being the highest ſtrein and pitch of ſublime and tranſcendant Honour, that Mortality could ever exert or phancy; and higher still, if that zeal were well guided with diſcretion, (as the Apoſtle requires,) and not taken upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due trust; whereof if there were not ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest cauſe to doubt, or fear, none were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, and worthy to be deſerted forever by Your R. H. than him, who having had once the honour, to adhere to you in your military dangers, ſhould want a heart at laſt to follow you in your Eccleſiaſtical motions after truth, my more proper Element and Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Having therefore, as I ought, doubted my ſelf not a little, and reviewed my Principles upon this occaſion, and with beſt endeavours of Brain
<pb facs="tcp:41014:5"/>
and Knee, ſtudied to know the Truth, and Gods mind herein, with a heart reſolv'd to be of its ſide, to my power, against the World, it ſeem'd agreeable to Ministerial obligation, as well as Loyal Reputation, to communicate my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the World, in the view of your R. H. that all might ſee, that nothing elſe was able to make a Loyal <hi>Brittain</hi> ſhrinke from the ſteps of his Prince, but a greater Loyalty to the manifest rights of God, and the King, and the Truth.</p>
            <p>Which I truſt, will not be construed Contempt, but Constancy, nothing being more the duty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Loyal Servant, (and a Minister eſpecially,) than to be as faithful to his Prince, (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to God and the Nation,) as Conſcience is in every breast, which will never approve, or agree to any diſloyal revolt from Heaven and Truth, but will chuſe rather to be ſilenc'd for a time than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and with patient agony refer the matter to God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor are any to be reckon'd ſtraight-way unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, (as is the manner of ſome weak and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſons, and <hi>Turba Bemi,</hi> and alſo the Divinity of ſome grave Deacons of the belly, and preſent eaſe and greatneſs,) for any wound, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, they may bring upon themſelves, for ſuch fidelity to the Temporal and Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of their Master, either from declar'd, which is more faire, or undeclar'd, and inviſible Hoſtilities, which is leſs: For ſuch ſuffer in their
<pb facs="tcp:41014:5"/>
manifest <hi>duties,</hi> which is therefore to be preſum'd to be their <hi>choice</hi> by conſequence, (when ſuch need require) and their right, and best ſelf-preſervation, (if they be right men or Christians,) for if we are bound to love our Neighbours as our ſelves at the least, ſo much more our Prince, and Countrey, above our ſelves, as the hand doth the head.</p>
            <p>And greater and truer love cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, than by long miſery and durance for the Truth, like an Anchor under Waves, to hold fast the great Soul of one's Prince (compos'd of Grace and Mercy, and the fear of God,) by his bowells and compaſſion, stronger than any Cable, from running against Eternal Rocks, and claſhing with his Heavenly Sovereign; which is the first, and Original diſloyalty, and inſurrection against the <hi>Chief,</hi> whereof the Tumults of Subjects against <hi>Secondary</hi> Mortal Soveraigns, are uſually but copies, and fatal conſequences, by man's manifest fault, but Gods ſecret righteous judgement, as the fear and ſubjection of the Creature is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by Divines to be abated and impair'd towards <hi>Adam,</hi> after his fall.</p>
            <p>And no Prince can more deſerve ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrial fidelity from Servants, and Subjects, than your R: H. not only upon the ſcore of Loyalty and Conſcience, common to all Princes, but of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and peculiar merit, and exemplary frequent fatigues, and hazards, and lovely deportments on the confines of life and death, for the glory of
<pb facs="tcp:41014:6"/>
your Country, which your R. H. valued above your life, and preſent, and hereditary greatneſs, as much, as many mean and vulgar ſpirits, do below their petty ſelf-ends and differences.</p>
            <p>And that great fight cannot eaſily depart from my remembrance of your ſerene Magnanimity, and cheerful unconcernedneſs on Quarter Deck, <hi>June 3d. 1665.</hi> which betoken'd to my hopes, a great diſtance of dangers from your R. H. even then, when Roaring deaths hail'd thick about your R. Perſon, and beſprinkled your Buff with the bloud of your ever memorable Companions, that fell by you. Such contempt of death, and the Pomp, and Glory of this World, for the defence of your King, and Country, being a lively reſemblance of that true Chriſtian Charity, which doth the like for Chriſt, and ſouls: and fits the underſtanding to receive, and embrace the truth. And I have just cauſe often to bleſs God, for a kind of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reward then, of my many Prayers in private for your R. H. (which was my chief, and ſole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in your defence) that your R. H. ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and declare it as an Omen of Victory, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to the publick Service and Exhortation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by me the even before the fight, by your R. H. appointment, that one of the greatest Ships of the Enemy, ſhould take fire in that moment in the fight of both Fleets, reported to be one of the member that were particularly bound to deſtroy you.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The <hi>root</hi> of ſuch mens miſtake lies in this, that they conceive <hi>Subordinates</hi> to be <hi>contrary,</hi> and <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> wholly to deſtroy the <hi>poſitive;</hi> that <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>hand</hi> cannot go together; that the body and the ſoul, and God and man, and Heaven and Earth be <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi> becauſe the one doth ſo far excell and out-go the other.</p>

               </gap>, and their uſe and goodneſs with their being by conſequence: As the Earth is nothing in reſpect of Heaven, and <hi>England</hi> therefore (ſo ſmall a part of the Earth) is leſs than nothing in all reaſon: However by it ſelf poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conſidered, it is a large Territory of many dayes Journey, conſiſting of ſeveral Counties, and famous Towns, and Cities, affording large materials, for Laws, and Government, and Order.</p>
            <p>But if Monk and Seperatiſt be compar'd as to the conſequence of their principles, or the ſincerity of their Diſcipline; the one is found to wrong <hi>himſelf</hi> only; the other, publick <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>order:</hi> The one to deſpiſe the <hi>World,</hi> (which agrees with a Chriſtian) the other to deſpiſe <hi>Government,</hi> (which too much agrees with Antichriſt, <hi>Jud.</hi> 8. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.) withall, it's far eaſier to fleſh and bloud to abſtain from bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or kneeling, or capping, than to wear Sack-cloath, or to live on Bread and Water all ones life: Its eaſier I ſay, and leſs ſubject to taking cold, to change <hi>you,</hi> into <hi>thou,</hi> than to walk bare-foot all the year; therefore the Monk ſtands further off from the Hypocrite, than the Quaker, though from the unwiſe, both much at equal diſtance.</p>
            <p>To place all Religion and Service of God in <hi>opere operato,</hi> or the work outwardly done, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the heart or underſtanding, is <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Popiſh:</hi> To place none in the <hi>outward Reverence</hi> of the body, before Angels and men, is <hi>Rude,</hi> and <hi>Fanatical,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41014:17"/>
Scandalous: To perform all the parts of our <hi>outward</hi> duties with care and Reverence; but to judge them as <hi>nothing,</hi> and as meer formality, compared to the <hi>truth</hi> and ſincerity of our hearts to Chriſt, this is <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> and Regular Religion, and well pleaſing in the ſight of God and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>For great is the <hi>natural,</hi> greater (or more ſenſible) is the <hi>moral</hi> difference between our Bodies and Souls: The Body (like matter in <hi>Plato</hi>) is a vaſt, ſpungy, dull, Earthly, lump, and ſubſtance; without any life, or ſpirit: But the Soul, is a contract, and ſtrong, and indiviſible, divine, and lively eſſence, and ſpirit, being that in the Body, what God is in the World, <hi>tota in toto:</hi> Giving life, and motion, and vigour, to all its parts; <hi>minimum maximi m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the <hi>moral</hi> difference between them, (currant in Converſation, and the eſteem, and value of God, and man) ſeems much greater: Five words of real <hi>Engliſh</hi> truth from the heart, are better received with all men, than ten thouſand Complements and Grima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though a vaſt <hi>Eſtate</hi> be greatly valued in the World, (for the port and reſpect that attends it) yet <hi>health,</hi> and life, have far the pre-eminence, when ever they ſtand in Competition: Yet the one, and the other, both Eſtate and life, ſet againſt the Soul, become ſo little worth, that they both muſt expoſe themſelves at its beck, into Martyrdom, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration, and the Canons mouth, to defend and make good, but any <hi>one</hi> Article of Faith, any <hi>one</hi> Principle of Honour and Loyalty in the <hi>heart:</hi> And your Hectors bid higher, who by their Hair-brain Duells, and ſickly Luxuries, and hazardous and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Luſts, do loudly maintain, that an <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41014:18"/>
thought or fancy of the Soul, is of more value and price, than health and life, and all the World? What then muſt be the worth and value of thoughts, <hi>ſober,</hi> and wiſe, and true? What of the Soul <hi>it ſelf,</hi> the Matrix and mother of them all? Therefore God, who underſtands the nature of the Soul, takes it for no ſervice at all, but rather a contempt, which is offered to him by the lip without the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8. Ones whole life, ſpent in his ſervice, without the heart, is not one hour, or minute ſpent therein: If I ſpeak with the Tongue of men and Angels, and have not Charity, (that is, do it not for the Glory of God, and the Edification of men, from my heart) I am but as ſounding-braſs, and a tinckling-cymbal: If I beſtow all I have to the poor, and give my body to be burnt, and have not Charity (that is, do it for a vain Glory, or for ſome other reſpect, than from my heart to God) it profiteth me nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>But this ſecond and principal part of my Text, touching the Heart and Soul of our Actions, may for diſtincter method, be further explained and illuſtrated two ways: By ſhewing (1.) The <hi>Quomodo.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Quare.</hi> The <hi>Quomodo,</hi> how we are to Act, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in thoſe words. (1.) <hi>From the heart.</hi> (2.) <hi>To the Lord.</hi> (3.) <hi>Not to men.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Quare,</hi> why we are ſo to Act, is inſinuated in thoſe two words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Heart,</hi> and <hi>the Lord,</hi> and of theſe in Order.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) For the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> in the firſt place; <hi>Whatſoever we do, we muſt do it from the Heart</hi> which requires theſe three properties at leaſt. (1.) That we do it with <hi>Knowledge.</hi> (2.) With <hi>Freedom.</hi> (3.) With <hi>Conſcience</hi> to God, and no other: The <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (being the two parts of the Soul) require the two firſt;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41014:18"/>
and the natural <hi>bent</hi> and verticity of the Soul after God, (its only center and reſt) requires the <hi>laſt:</hi> For nothing is, or can be ſaid, to be done from the heart, which is not done for God, and before him: An honeſt hearty man, doth all, that he doth, as it were, upon his oath, becauſe he doth every thing from his heart, and Conſcience, in the preſence of God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In the firſt place, what is done from the heart, muſt be done with knowledge, and attention, (which is the wakefulneſs of knowledge.) For where there is no underſtanding, there can be no will, or rational conſent; (as in Beaſts, Idiots, Lunatiques, Minors, and perſons cheated, ſurpriz'd, miſs-led;) and where no will, then no heart; heart, will, Soul, and underſtanding, being all the ſame. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> decides it to be Idolatry to worſhip, even the true God, <hi>ignorantly;</hi> as in the Caſe of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Act.</hi> 17.23. And our Saviour Chriſt gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22. in the Caſe of the <hi>Samaritans, Ye worſhip</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you know not what.</hi> In our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours account, God is not reckoned to be worſhipped by thoſe, that worſhip him ignorantly, or blindly, hit or miſs; whether him, or an Idol, or Uſurper in his ſtead.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) With freedom, which implies two things. (1.) The excluſion of <hi>force</hi> and fear. (2.) Neceſſity of <hi>Grace</hi> and Gods aſſiſtance: For force and fear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the will, and all hearty conſent and delight, as much as ignorance and errour did; for what we do by <hi>force</hi> and fear, we do it from a principle <hi>without,</hi> to ſave our skins; but what we do from the Heart, we do it from a principle <hi>within,</hi> in complyance with truth and juſtice, or Gods mind, wherewith the heart complies of its own accord:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41014:19"/>
Theſe being ſo diametrically contrary to one another; therefore <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>force</hi> can never ſtand well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If Religion is to ſpring from the heart, as ſaith my Text, its abſurdity and contradiction to propagate it by force: Governours <hi>may,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>ought,</hi> to uſe the diſcipline of the Rod and power <hi>paternally,</hi> towards obſtinate and froward Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to create <hi>Attention</hi> and reſpect in them towards the truth, but to uſe <hi>Axe,</hi> or <hi>Fag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot,</hi> to <hi>burn</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> the Lives of all Diſſenters, is far from the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55. Which method began to be in practice, when Religion without a Heart, (and conſequently without God) began to be in faſhion in the World, and <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> worſhipped and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd above Chriſt himſelf; and the Wood of the Croſs, above the Myſtery of the Croſs; and a frail Father on Earth, above our Father in Heaven. And as the growth and prevalence of the true Church, over Idolatry and Hereſie, was by truth and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benificence, which tended to win the heart, like the Suns victory over darkneſs, which it early diſpells with its light and rayes without noiſe or bloud-ſhed; yet with a ſufficient Glorious alteration in the World: So the growth of the falſe, hath moſtly ever been, by ignorance, and Fire, and Gun-powder, which quench and alienate mens hearts and ſpirits; or like the March of the Grand Seigniour, which burns and deſtroys all that ſtands in its way.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The neceſſity of the Aſſiſtance of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, obtainable by ſervent Prayer, to renew and make us truly free and right,: without whoſe <hi>Illumination,</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> of our minds and hearts, we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>know,</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> what is truly good, nor in our hearts be affected towards it. The carnall man, who

               </gap>en, through the Croſs and death of Chriſt, and the mortification of his fleſh, by Faſting and Prayer, the Soul dies to this preſent world, and the luſts thereof; and by that death of Faith, is ſet at liberty, and detach'd, as men ſay, from ſuch ſnares and fetters, then it can ſoar as an Eagle, and aſcend in its affections, in the power of Chriſts aſcention, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, its true reſt and center, with delight and eaſe. All are for eaſe and reſt, both godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: the reſt and pleaſure of the juſt and unjuſt differ from one another, but by truth and appearance; both purſue their vices and virtues from the heart; the one with a falſe, the other with true, delight and ſatisfaction: Wine, and Women, and the like, which take away the heart <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. are purſued from the heart, by their ſeveral followers; but with a void and dead conſent, becauſe of the deceit, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they meet in them: thus all ſinners tire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forever in a maze of contradictory and abſurd elections and ſhort-liv'd joyes; ſoon repenting, and hating that bliſs, they eagerly chuſe and purſue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they put up falſe Coyn for true, through want of skill and care, and take their counſels and meaſures from ſenſe, and the fleſh, and not from the Soul or renewed mind, to chuſe objects for their hearts to reſt on, as ſhall never deceive or diſappoint their expectation, none being ſuch, but God or Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41014:20"/>Which is the third property requir'd in our doing, whatſoever we do from the heart, and contains the remaining parts of the <hi>Quomodo, To the Lord, and not to men,</hi> which may be ſpoken to, together. The heart of man, is not for two contraries at once, God and <hi>Mammon;</hi> Chriſt and a luſt together: the Soul abhors all ſuch Polygamy: it is either wholly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividedly for God, and all elſe for his ſake: or wholly for its prime luſt and Idol, which thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, as a God unto it; For out of a God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, true or falſe, the Soul can neither Act, nor move, nor ſtir: therefore the verſe before the text, requires Chriſt to be ſerved and obey'd with <hi>ſingleneſs</hi> of heart, which if it be done for any wordly end, or deſign, as the chief motive of the heart; the heart is divided, or <hi>doubled</hi> between them; and a <hi>double</hi> heart is <hi>no</hi> heart, the diviſion of the heart and will, deſtroys it; and Chriſt is not ſerv'd, or obey'd at all, but rather Irritated and provok'd to enmity againſt us, by our making other ends partners in our hearts, of that glory and worſhip, which is due to him alone: whereby you may perceive the world is to withdraw, and depart out of ſight and hearing, when the Chriſtian Soul comes upon the Stage, to Act its part before its God alone, like a Nightingale in a ſtill calm, it being below the Soul to ſing her part to any other ear: neither can the heart own any competent ſpectator of its Actions, but Him alone, who can ſearch, and judge it.</p>
            <p>And what is more agreable (as with this text) ſo with the great care of our Saviour alſo in the right ordering of our Religious Actions, our Alms, and Faſting, and Prayer, that we do all to <hi>Gods</hi> eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not to be ſeen of <hi>men Math.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. For if we do the ſame for men, we have our reward, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41014:20"/>
is, they muſt pay us who ſet us on work; or, for whom we chuſe to work: but if for God in ſecret, then God who ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward us open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we pray in our Cloſets, it muſt be to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone intirely, being more ſeen and heard by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, than if we prayed in the ſight and hearing of the whole world: If we pray in the Church, (where we are ſeen of men,) we are not ſo to pray, that <hi>men</hi> may praiſe our devotions, but that <hi>God</hi> may approve our hearts, we are to Pray in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and our heart, in the midſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as in a deſert: In duties of the Pulpit, Bench, or Shop, our chief aim muſt not be lucre; or vain glory, the fear, or the favour of any, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proving of our hearts and conſciences to Chriſt, which will make us juſt, and bold, and ſober, and tender: We are not to be dejected or caſt down for any loſs, but the loſs of Chriſts favour by our ſins, which ſorrow is its own cure: we are not to eſteem our ſelves better than others in any thing, but where we can out-go them in conformity to our meek and humble Saviour, which kind of humility is true and Divine Grandeur: nor to count our ſelves at eaſe, amidſt our eaſe and plenty, till we find it to go well with Chriſt and his Church, which is our zeal and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian (that Acts all in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, and for Chriſt,) ſuper-induces Chriſt upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> and upon every <hi>other</hi> perſon, he hath to do with; as the colour of the glaſs ſhall colour all the objects the eye ſees through it, even as envy and malice on the contrary, ſees the Devil in every Brother, and finds him in it ſelf.

He is faithfull and diligent in his Maſters buſineſs, againſt his ſloath and temptations, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with himſelf, he ſerves not man, but Chriſt, as in my Text. In a relation of husband or wife, Chriſt and his Church are to be acted betwen them, the one is to love his wife, (for all her frailties,) as Chriſt loved his Church; the other is to honour her Husband, againſt her diſcontents, as the Church honours Chriſt: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22, 25.

            <p n="1">(1.) The firſt is, from the fundamental nature and fabrick of our Souls, which bear a connatural, imbred allegiance, and ſubjection to God, and no other, to whom they are as Uniſons, or Correlates, as the eye was made to anſwer the Light, or the herb <hi>Heliotropium</hi> to move at the motion of the Sun; or, as your common Daiſies, that (as it were with mourning and joy,) ſhut and open, according as they loſe, or enjoy, the Sun: Our Souls are not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> independant unaccountable beings; (that were for a Creature to be the ſame, as God is;) but are ſubject and reſponſible for all their moſt inward deſigns and actions, and that to God alone, and no other: All Earthly powers, and their threats, and bonds, they flight, and defie, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his Withs and Cords, or <hi>Leviathan</hi> doth Iron and Braſs, to him, but as ſtraw and ſtubble: But God or Chriſt

they will own as their Leige, who governs them by a <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> I mean <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is the <hi>ſame</hi> with the <hi>heart,</hi> in my Text, which ſeems to be no other, than the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf made an Officer or Regiſter, both for, and againſt it ſelf, to view, and record, and report all paſſages impartially againſt the great Tribunal, being a manifeſt demonſtration of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe power of that Almighty Soveraign, who thus controlls and rules this potent and lofty ſpirit, the Soul of man, and all for its good.</p>
            <p>Rather than to be without a God to Worſhip, by way of <hi>virtue</hi> and Religion; the Soul will chuſe an Idol to ſerve, by way of <hi>Vice</hi> and Idolatry. There are two experiments to be remarked in the worſt of ſinners, that irrefragably prove a God. The firſt is, their infinite inſatiable appetite after their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Luſts, (which is that true <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Avarice, which Scripture ſtiles Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſecond is, that forlorn guilt and anguiſh that the Conſcience ever meets with, <hi>(criminibus peractis,)</hi> as the Poet ſaid, as ſoon as the Commiſſion of the ſin is over, which no Creature for the preſent can allay, or ſtill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Gods pardon upon Repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; or the help of time at leaſt to forget it, whereby the heart, like the skin, grows more hard and ſenſeleſs, by its wounds ill Cur'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe two effects very evidently prove, it was a Divine and an Infinite Bliſs and Happineſs, the Soul did aim at, and forfeit, in all its wicked fruitions and diſappointments; ſuch an <hi>unbounded</hi> manner of <hi>Purſuing,</hi> and <hi>Ruing,</hi> being as clear an argument, as ten thouſand miracles, to prove the exiſtence, and nearneſs of the deity to mens Actions, but that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls, by the habit and Cuſtom of vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Callous</hi> and <hi>Bedlam</hi>-like, inſenſible, and ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41014:22"/>
wholly brutal, and un-attentive after God, as the very beaſts, that periſh; in whom we commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſeveral ſhadows and reſemblances of our own <hi>Reaſon</hi> in ſome degree, but not the leaſt ſenſe, or footſtep, or inclination after Religion, or Altars, or Sacraments: This being the peculiar imploy, and prerogative, of Immortal Spirits. Seeing therefore our Souls cannot be without either <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Idol,</hi> to ſerve and fear; and cannot ſerve <hi>both,</hi> or <hi>neither;</hi> it is not only our <hi>duty,</hi> but <hi>neceſſity,</hi> to chuſe to do all we do, <hi>rightly</hi> from the heart, to the <hi>true</hi> God alone, to our unſpeakable <hi>comfort</hi> and reward; than <hi>erroneouſly,</hi> to Worldly and private ends or Idols, to our everlaſting miſery and ruine. This is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from the fundamental conſtitution, and Genius of our Souls, which were made from the beginning, (as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice) to walk and converſe <hi>only</hi> with God: and the good lives of the beſt Patriarchs, are remarkably compriz'd in Scripture, in a phraſe to the ſame effect, <hi>That they walked with God.</hi> And our own Law reſolves all Crimes in her Indictments, into one Cauſe, <hi>The want of the fear of God before mens eyes:</hi> And why is it, that peace of Conſcience can defie the frowns of the whole World; and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and affluence of the World, cannot quiet a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd mind, but that the entire concern and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of man is found by all experience to be <hi>ſolely</hi> and <hi>immediatly</hi> in God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is implyed, in the word <hi>Lord,</hi> who is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For Chriſt became Lord of Chriſtians, by purchaſe and merit, by dying for them, as the Apoſtle Argues, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. In whoſe <hi>Death</hi> and Croſs, this preſent World hath its <hi>end</hi> and period by <hi>Faith,</hi> as the <hi>Old World</hi> in the <hi>deluge,</hi> by Gods <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And the Chriſtian Church, is a <hi>New raiſed</hi>

            <p>Which in the firſt place is of infinite uſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to the right ordering and proſperity of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Communities, whether thoſe <hi>Majorum Gentium,</hi> of the greater ſize and ſort, that of <hi>Church,</hi> and Common-wealth, or mankind in General; or other <hi>particular Fraternities</hi> of a leſſer compaſs, formed after the mould and imitation of thoſe greater: For nothing ever was given more uſeful to the World, to ſodder and ſtrengthen Societies and

            <p>Men are weak, and comfortleſs, and of a narrow ſphere, while alone; but grow ſtrong, and goodly, and formidable, and uſeful to all, and to one another, when united and confederated together, in lawful bands and Brother-hoods; as, I need not prove, your vocation and eſtabliſhment to be, which is founded not only upon the indiſpenſable needs of men, but the expreſs allowance alſo, and the approbation of Laws both Humane and Divine. It is not <hi>Wealth,</hi> or Gold, or Purſe, makes Intereſt and Power, but <hi>men</hi> and friends: as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves in his offices, for <hi>thoſe,</hi> without <hi>theſe,</hi> would little avail to our aid or comfort; neither are we ever ſure of <hi>men,</hi> to be on our ſides, or fully to be truſted in, till firſt we are ſure of their <hi>hearts,</hi> and nothing more wins and binds the <hi>hearts</hi> of men unto us, than our <hi>hearts</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> whether <hi>with</hi> our gift, or <hi>without:</hi> nothing ſo charms the heart of another, as a heart to meet it, as no <hi>loſs</hi> more weakens, and <hi>dethrones,</hi> than the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>hearts.</hi> Now this communion and fellowſhip of hearts and ſouls, is no where ſo to be learnt or acquired, as in the School of Chriſt, who is the ſole legiſlator and judge of Souls and hearts,</p>
            <p>I'le Inſtance therefore in a conciſe deſcription of a true and falſe Brother, or member of this, or that Society, whether greater or ſmaller, according to the Chriſtian pattern, and the Apoſtical rule of my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41014:24"/>
Text; to point but at the one, or the other, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient praiſe and reproof for either.</p>
            <p>A right Brother then of his Society, is him, in a word, that is <hi>true hearted;</hi> which no man ever was, or will be, without diſcharging every duty, that lies upon him, out of <hi>conſcience</hi> to God, and his Saviour; he conſiders aright, his <hi>livelihood,</hi> and priviledge, his love, and honour, from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or Charter, to which he relates, and his <hi>duty</hi> ariſing from his priviledge, and the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhowring upon him, and his, while he conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly performs his <hi>duty.</hi> He conſiders, that by being of a Society, he hath a <hi>new</hi> and a larger ſelf than before, (being co-extended and co-multiplied, according to the number and conſiderableneſs of the whole Brotherhood whereof he is) and with this new-ſelf, a <hi>new-ſelf preſervation</hi> by conſequence, and a larger care doth grow upon him: before he was but <hi>one,</hi> and had but one to care for, now he is grown into <hi>hundreds,</hi> and hath hundreds therefore to love, and tender, even as he is tendered by them. For it's manifeſt, the whole body owns the concerns of every the leaſt member belonging to it, and if a toe be but cruſhed, the pain goes to head, and heart, and all. He conceives it therefore but equity and reaſon, that he ſhould anſwer love with love, that his gratitude ſhould indent with his advantage from his Society; yea, that his returns of love ſhould exceed his receipts, like the good ground, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs an handful of ſeed with an Harveſt. He loves therefore every Brother of his community, <hi>equall,</hi> yea <hi>above</hi> himſelf, or his own <hi>ſingle</hi> concern therein: being thus <hi>match'd</hi> and exhauſted in his disburſments and duty towards any <hi>one,</hi> what ſtock hath he left to anſwer the love of the <hi>whole</hi> community, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41014:25"/>
are <hi>hundreds</hi> of friends and defenders of <hi>him,</hi> who is but <hi>one,</hi> againſt them? here he finds himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent and over match'd with love, and ſtudies to get out of debt, but cannot; and gladly would he meet ſome ſtreit, or tryal, or expence, ſome happy kind of prejudice or honourable undoing of himſelf, to do them ſome publick good, and to teſtifie his <hi>preference</hi> of them by <hi>proſtration,</hi> and an humble annihilation of himſelf before them: this is but the temper, and due diſpoſition of every member, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the publick good, and preſervation of that Body or Community, whereof he is: all true and Generous Spirits, have their greateſt wiſh and bliſs, when an opportunity is offered them, to preſerve and defend their Country, though with the manifeſt hazard of their lives. <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum eſt pro patriâ mori:</hi> and ſo it is, and ought to be, in ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel proportion, in every leſſer Corporation. It is not only the <hi>duty,</hi> but the <hi>delight</hi> of every genuine member thereof, to Sacrifice his whole <hi>private</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein, for its <hi>publick</hi> welfare, when <hi>neceſſity</hi> ſhall require; and <hi>a greater</hi> allegiance to a <hi>greater</hi> Society, or <hi>ſtronger</hi> relation, ſhall not countermand him.</p>
            <p>Thus he <hi>lives,</hi> and thus he <hi>dies;</hi> and when he dies, his whole Society die with him, in grief and ſorrow for the loſs of ſo dear a Brother, ſo true a heart: yea they will not ſuffer him to die, nor his name to ſee corruption, but attend him ſolemnly to his grave, loaded with reſpect and mourning: What, to leave him there behind them? No; but to combat death for his reſcue; and to raiſe him from the dead, in the ſtrength of their love, (to which nothing is impoſſible) and to bring him back into a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> and immortality in their hearts and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41014:25"/>
memories: this life of <hi>honour,</hi> and good name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new life, and better than <hi>natural</hi> life it ſelf, in the ſenſe of civilized mankind. But he is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with them, being pre-embalm'd, and ſecur'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all aſſaults of death, by his brazen wall, the Teſtimony of a good conſcience: for a good <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is infinitely better, and more durable than a good <hi>name.</hi> This is the <hi>Original</hi> life of <hi>honour,</hi> to which that from our neighbours, is but the <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> and eccho; ſubject to miſtakes both of love and malice: But his bleſſed Saviour, who is greater than his conſcience, is as much before-hand with him, in point of life to be reſtored, as he was with them: his merciful Saviour graciouſly conſiders, this poor man, in all his toyl and imployment, his <hi>heart</hi> did ever aim at <hi>me;</hi> and ſhall I do nothing for him in his low condition, now he is given by all for loſt? he conſiders when his <hi>feet</hi> travell'd toward his <hi>Patients,</hi> his <hi>heart,</hi> the ſame time, travell'd towards <hi>Heaven</hi> and God: that he tender'd the lives and purſes of his charge, the bills and reputation of his directors: the orders and weal of his Society, (either his obedience to it, or place of truſt in it) (which all carry ſome equivalence to life) all from his heart and conſcience, doing as he would be done by, in the ſight of Chriſt, his Lord and Judge; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting by Divine Chymiſtry, ſome ſervice and worſhip to his Saviour, out of every imployment on Earth; Chriſt therefore owns him to have been his Miniſter and Servant all the while, (and not the Communities.) Now to be provided for, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by a bountiful Maſter, who hath ability and inclination to effect it to ſome purpoſe; and this good and faithful Servant, ſhall now enter into his Maſters joy, and be crowned with that aſtoniſhing

bliſs and Immortality, to which all <hi>honour</hi> and good name here below, (ſo much valued in the world,) were but empty ſhadows and <hi>chances:</hi> and peace of conſcience it ſelf, which paſſeth all underſtanding, but a ſhort glimpſe and fore-taſt. Dearly beloved and honour'd, let me leave this leſſon in your mind, <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam;</hi> that no man is <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>unfortunate,</hi> but he alone, that hath <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the judge of Quick and Dead, to be his <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> his <hi>Friend,</hi> by <hi>loving</hi> Chriſt; his <hi>Enemy,</hi> by <hi>wounding</hi> Chriſt in any <hi>Brother, Act.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.39. and bleſs ye his Holy name, and ſerve him from the heart for ever, who doth ſo eſpouſe each your concerns and Protection, as to count <hi>your</hi> Friends, <hi>his</hi> Friends: <hi>your</hi> Enemies, <hi>his</hi> Enemies; yea <hi>your ſelves</hi> his <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Enemies,</hi> according as your ſelves either <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and love or hate <hi>Chriſt</hi> by conſequence in <hi>them.</hi>

            <p>And as for the <hi>falſe Brother</hi> of his Society, I am loath to <hi>rip</hi> him up before you (though contraries ſerve to Illuſtrate one another,) for fear of <hi>offence</hi> to any of your <hi>ſences,</hi> though he be yet above ground; yet ſeeing many of you perhaps, have been well innur'd to ſuch hardſhips, for the benefit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I'le diſſect and open his <hi>breaſt</hi> only, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you manifeſtly, that his diſeaſe lies, where the others health and ſoundneſs lay in, <hi>the heart.</hi> I mean, a <hi>rotten heart,</hi> baſe and Hypocriticall, and falſe, and ſtuffed with nothing elſe, but ſordid <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and private ends, that engroſſed all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and care, either for his Brethren, or Superiours or Country; inverting and confounding the order and courſe of nature in him, ſetting the toe above the head, the Subject above Soveraign, the weal of one member above the weal of the other, or the

ſafety of the whole, or principal; though the decay of the one, involves in it, of neceſſity, the decay of the other likewiſe, and his folly returns upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being ſerved by others, as he ſerved them, all caring as little for him, as he cared for them, and his <hi>ſelf-love</hi> at long running, found to be <hi>ſelf-loſs,</hi> and to devour it ſelf, as well as its neighbours, for want of a right rule to guide it.</p>

            <p>And indeed without this Rule in my Text to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and enliven, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis—it ſelf,</hi> (which is the Rule of Rules, and the ſum of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,) all Societies and enjoyments, all converſe and friendſhip, would be falſe, irregular and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: Friendſhip it ſelf would be <hi>Hollow-hearted,</hi> Counſels treacherous, Promiſes wind, mens tongues full of nought, but lyes, their hearts of uncleanneſs, and their hands of bloud and unrighteouſneſs: Their Juſtice would be Cruelty, their Wealth an Idol, their Power Tyranny, their fears wild and cauſeleſs, their Joys and pleaſures mean and ſordid, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Feavers, their mirth madneſs, their Sorrows Apoplexies, their Reaſons Vagabond, their beſt works, but outward ſhew, their Vertues Scene and Hypocriſie.

When the <hi>heart</hi> agrees with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> its rule and Judge, all Hypocriſie and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity departs: when our <hi>thoughts</hi> agree with ſuch a <hi>heart,</hi> they are cur'd of their vanity; when our <hi>lips</hi> agree with ſuch <hi>thoughts,</hi> and ſuch a heart, ſuch a rule, and Judge, there will be no deceit in them; when every <hi>Action</hi> of our whole man copies out our <hi>heart,</hi> as our <hi>heart</hi> copies out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our Original perfection; which conſiſts in agreement to that <hi>Idea,</hi> and Image of God in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true Righteouſneſs, according to which we were created by him, and were reſtored to it, by Chriſt, as we fell from it, in the fall. <hi>This</hi> is <hi>Truth,</hi> throughout the whole man, and Chriſtian: and that Truth perhaps, which <hi>Pilate deſired,</hi> but did not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi> to know from our Saviour. For in ſuch Acts and converſe, which have <hi>life</hi> in them, as from the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> and Holineſs, as unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Souls of all men, upon trial and experience, find <hi>Truth</hi> and ſatisfaction, and peace of conſcience in them (and but <hi>diſappointment,</hi> and vexation, and lies, ever in the contrary.) And Praiſe and Honour, and ſhame and Infamy, from men; and Life, and Death, Eternal, from God, following cloſe upon the heels of the one and the other, are ſuffrages for this Truth, beyond exception.</p>
            <p>And what makes good men, makes good Subjects and Rulers, by eaſie conſequence.

whereof Hiſtories (eſpecially Heatheniſh) are ſo full, (and ſome Chriſtian, to their greater ſhame:) But in Chriſt, (our ſubjection being transferr'd over from <hi>men</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi>) our <hi>ſlavery</hi> is extinguiſh'd, and our ſervice enobled, and made agreeable to our Souls, which know no Lord over them, but God and Chriſt; and all pride, and <hi>ſtubborneſs,</hi> and ſecret murmuring, is now turn'd into good will, from the heart towards our Superiours, whether mild or hard: As is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taken notice of by the Apoſtle, and with care recommended to Inferiours in a parallel place, <hi>Epheſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>BUt in the Second place, I ſhall chuſe to enlarge and inſiſt, upon a more neceſſary Exhortation, becauſe the danger of ſeduction grows daily greater, that you, and all other Chriſtians here in <hi>Britain,</hi> would be carefull to preſerve your ſelves, true and ſtedfaſt members (in the day of tryal,) of an higher Society, into which you were early enrolled, for more Holy and Eternal purpoſes, and to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to your own good Laws, and the Governours that are over you by Providence, and by conſequence to God himſelf in them, and not to fall off (as many falſe hearts are like to do, like leaves in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,</hi> upon a cold nip or trial,) into forraign Dirt, and Captivity, and impoſture; from which the Wiſdom and zeal of your Progenitors have ſet you free; for Originally (as the learned on both ſides know,) our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church never was a <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor Subject to its See; being <hi>Ancienter</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>Seniour</hi> to the Church, and Chair of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, or the firſt arrival of St. <hi>Peter</hi> there, were the Tradition, or Legend, true.

ſome will by no means allow.

And the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> themſelves (as they love to be called) cannot be denied to be every Mothers Son, as <hi>Infallible,</hi> as the <hi>Judge</hi> himſelf, or their <hi>Church</hi> is, to whom they give themſelves <hi>entirely</hi> over to be guided by them: take therefore in Gods name, Gods clear mind; and meaſure and judge impartially, with the heart and ſoul, and in the ſtrength of him, that guides you.</p>

And upon this ſcore perhaps it was, that one of the great and Sainted Patriarchs of an order amongſt them, began to beſtow his pains and zeal in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Birds. When men, in contrariety to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in my Text, judge it fanatical Innovation to Worſhip God (as Proteſtants do) with the heart and underſtanding: They that ſo exclude the <hi>heart</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, as needleſs; will they not exclude the <hi>Lord</hi> likewiſe in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place?

               </p>
               <p>And yet upon ſuch holy guides, ſuch infallible Rocks, the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Church is built: For all with them are bound to believe as the <hi>Church</hi> (that is the <hi>Pope</hi>) believes, whom they believe to be infallible. For though their <hi>lives</hi> are often <hi>frail</hi> and vicious, yet their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or Teſtimonies for God, (ſay they) are ever firm and true. As if a Vicious life were not an effectual quenching and renouncing of the whole Faith of ſuch a perſon, during ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence; or as if a Debauch'd perſon, or Atheiſt, were a fit witneſs for the Chriſtian Faith, much leſs the Judge thereof. He that will be <hi>Infallible</hi> for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ought firſt to be <hi>Infallible</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and his own Salvation: And every man is bound, upon his everlaſting Peril, to be as Infallible as he can, for himſelf and his Brethren: But, as a Creature, no man is, or can be Infallible; <hi>nec vox hominem Sonat,</hi> but more or leſs, he may be Infallible, by help from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, according as he is guided wholly, or in part, by God, who is alone Infallible: And the iſſue and whole ſtate of the cauſe and difference, between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> lyes in the right <hi>choice</hi> and election of their <hi>Infallible guide</hi> and <hi>judge:</hi> Who this is? being the great Queſtion.

The whole Controverſy lyes therefore in the <hi>choice,</hi> or <hi>rejection,</hi> in <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>diſobedience,</hi> to the right guide or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Soveraign of the heart; whether <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Pope:</hi> And exact <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>wrong,</hi> becomes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>diſobedience,</hi> to the <hi>right</hi> Superiour. And that the Iſſue will lye here, may further appear from each ones caſe ſtated by himſelf; and their charge and imputation each againſt the other, and from the ſtate of the queſtion naturally ariſing hereupon. For the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, they take <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> (and what agrees thereto) for the <hi>guide</hi> and rule of their <hi>hearts</hi> and judgments: And that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take the <hi>Pope;</hi> and hold opinions and practices upon his <hi>Authority</hi> againſt Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting God therein, and preferring <hi>man</hi> before <hi>him,</hi> which is <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> or making the <hi>Pope</hi> an <hi>Idol.</hi> And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the contrary ſay, they obey the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Chriſts <hi>Infallibe Vicar</hi> on Earth in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41014:38"/>
and thereby <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> by conſequence, and enjoy <hi>Peace</hi> and Union agmonſt themſelves, as the reward of this <hi>Submiſſion;</hi> And that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are guided by a <hi>Private ſpirit</hi> (which cannot be ſeen or met) under the colour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Scripture; and are led and Imbroyled by it in Eternal <hi>Sects</hi> and Diviſions, which is a <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> that cannot be of God. And I ſuppoſe, both ſides will eaſily ſubſcribe this repetition of their Caſe, and main exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other to be faithful, and true, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their minds. Now there are <hi>Three Queſtions</hi> to be run over, to find out the <hi>true,</hi> wherein we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. The firſt, of <hi>Right,</hi> the ſecond, of <hi>Opinion,</hi> the third, of <hi>Fact.</hi> The firſt, (or <hi>Queſtio juris</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>General,</hi> or the Abſtract, without relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to parties or circumſtances, whether I ſay, by way of Major Propoſition, <hi>Truth</hi> (as Gods mind) is to be follow'd by the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> to be <hi>ſhunned,</hi> (as contrary to his mind, and the nature of our ſouls) is out of queſtion, and by both agreed to. The ſecond, that each ſide believe, and ſuppoſe in their minds and perſwaſions, their own <hi>Opinion</hi> to be <hi>Truth,</hi> and their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> to be an <hi>errour,</hi> is alſo yeilded to: and that the Opinion of the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> that is <hi>Gods mind</hi> too as well as <hi>mans</hi> mind, is not the <hi>Private</hi> Opinion of <hi>man,</hi> but the <hi>abſolute Catholick Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to be followed by all hearts, which is a <hi>rule</hi> and meaſure to <hi>end</hi> the controverſie by: the Queſtion therefore between us is of <hi>Fact,</hi> or the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> and <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> What parties Opinion, is the mind of <hi>God</hi> too? whoſe <hi>Facts</hi> and principles agree with the <hi>right rule</hi> and guide? who <hi>do,</hi> as they ſhould <hi>do?</hi> or to put it in the words of my Text, which party doth, (whatſoever it doth) from the heart, as unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not unto men?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41014:38"/>
or who to <hi>men,</hi> and therefore not from the <hi>heart.</hi> unto the <hi>Lord:</hi> or by way of Simile, which Dyall moſt agrees with the Sun? it being pre-allowed, (1.) That the Sun goes right, (2.) That the Dyall which beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with it, is trueſt.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing hereof, the <hi>heart,</hi> as I have ſhewed, <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>alone</hi> without its guide, and confident to advize it, no more than Ivie without an Oak or Wall to bear it, or a ſtone without its weight, and Bias towards its Center. As of ſolitary perſons it's ſaid, they are either Angels or Beaſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the objects the ſoul is ſure to entertain, though ſolitary; ſo the heart can never be alone but (through heed, or heedleſneſs, and want of grace) will of neceſſity chuſe a God, <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falſe;</hi> either <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or boſom <hi>ſin,</hi> or a <hi>man of ſin,</hi> to be led by.

Chriſt will not admit of any Soveraign in the heart before, or beſide himſelf, which is obſerved to be the reaſon, he could not be received, according to the deſires of the Senate in the days of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Gods at <hi>Rome:</hi> for <hi>all</hi> were to be <hi>quitted,</hi>

to <hi>admit</hi> him: but boſom ſin is more Civil, will allow of Religion to co-habit with it; but if it offers to contradict, or controul, it muſt quit and pack: the <hi>man of ſin</hi> will admit both of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and diſpenſe with ſin, that may advance his Grandeur, and by all means admit of Chriſt, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Luſtre to his deſigns and ambition: but if ſin or Truth, ſhall offer to claſh with, or Impede his ſecular ends and Maſter Intereſt, the one ſhall be diſcontinued, the other excluded for expedience, and all to give place to the Soveraign who is own'd.</p>

never be <hi>flattered,</hi> or <hi>frighted</hi> to agree or <hi>yield</hi> to.) Thus the heart, through its own folly, ſuffers it ſelf to be ever diſturbed, and racked between <hi>two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Potentates,</hi> within its bowells: God, and <hi>Old Conſcience,</hi> command, and approve of natural <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>love to Countrey</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> to all in Miſery and Anxiety.

If the <hi>Pope</hi> be God and Lord of the Soul, and not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then we Proteſtants are much to blame in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our implicit obedience and ſubmiſſion to him: But if Chriſt be God, than we are ſafe, and have the truth of our ſide, and their errours are the more dangerous. And both theſe Maſters, (eſpecially of contrary wills, as it evidently appears) cannot be obeyed together, for there cannot be two Kings in the ſame Kingdom, nor two Suns in the ſame Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor two immortal Souls in the ſame man.</p>
               <p>But it will be alledged, as a Salve. (1.) That Gods commands in Scripture or Conſcience, bind not Chriſtians, but through the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them for us, leaſt we miſtake; and where they ſeem to croſs his will, to explain them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41014:42"/>
to us, or to diſpenſe with our obedience in that Caſe, which is an uſual practice at <hi>Rome,</hi> though it makes but <hi>one</hi> Maſter out of <hi>two,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>chief,</hi> alone; and Chriſt to ſtand but for a <hi>Cypher,</hi> or as a <hi>Minor,</hi> whoſe will is involv'd in his <hi>Guardian Viccar;</hi> hereby the <hi>Sun</hi> is meaſured by the <hi>Dyal,</hi> and not the <hi>Dial</hi> by the <hi>Sun.</hi> It makes Conſcience and Scriptures, (the greateſt gifts of Heaven) uſeleſs to Chriſtians, unleſs the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtand by in every place of the World to be conſulted with, by every Soul, which is Chriſts mind in all caſes and ſcruples: And ſets up man, inſtead of Chriſt, and confeſſes the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and gives up the Cauſe: This contrivance of aſſuming power to interpret the mind, and word of God, againſt the plain ſenſe thereof, being the firſt known invention of <hi>Satan</hi> in Paradice, who was the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> for which our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ought to ſuſpect themſelves in the Imitation, leaſt they diſcover themſelves too much. (2.) The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Salve will be, that out of obedience to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (who is in Heaven, afar off) they yield this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as his <hi>Viccar</hi> on Earth, as a more near and viſible officer under him, over them; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, not granting, this feigned truſt and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: It's againſt the nature of any truſt, for him that is truſted, to act contrary to the Intereſt of him that truſted him, and to be followed againſt his Principal. St. <hi>Paul</hi> would be followed by others, as far as he followed Chriſt, and no further, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. The Radical <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> lyes in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the heart and</hi> Judgment, and taking the outſide to be the man, and the meaſure of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and values, which by conſequence, muſt be Earthly and Carnal, and anſwering only to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man: But where the heart, which is the man,

               <p>HAving ſhewed, that no Chriſtian <hi>Churches,</hi> or perſons, are ſubject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> while <hi>himſelf</hi> is not ſubject to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the right Superiour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign over all; nor bound to offend againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to pleaſe his pretended <hi>Vicar;</hi> all being bound to withdraw their Communion from him, who ſhakes off the undoubted Soveraign over all: I will further ſhew, that though the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> were ſound and un-corrupt in its Doctrines and Loyalty, (which it is very far from,) yet it neither <hi>is,</hi> nor <hi>was,</hi> ever any <hi>mother Church,</hi> to our <hi>Britiſh Church,</hi> nor can have any right or title to its ſubjection or obedience.</p>
               <p>It never had any <hi>Original motherhood,</hi> or ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us of right, (nor in <hi>fact</hi> at any time, but by the Conceſſion of our Princes, <hi>impoſed</hi> upon by its <hi>arts,</hi> which they may juſtly recal, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at their pleaſure, as hath been done.)</p>
               <p>So it appears, it's themſelves that neceſſitate us to deſert their Communion, out of Chriſtian Loyalty to our Saviour, by them firſt deſerted and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a treaſonable manner; and his glorious Majeſty chang'd into the ſimilitude of a Calf, or a Mortal Creature, that periſheth, which is the firſt ſpring and root of the reſt of their deſperate and monſtrous Errours, which bear the manifeſt ſpots and tokens of

Antichriſtianiſm, in the ſtrength and infallibility of their Deluſions.

               <p>And firſt, as to the <hi>inſide</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Chriſtian Churches and of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, (if ſhe will be a Church of Chriſt, and of thouſands in her, that have not bowed the heart to any, but to Chriſt, known to God,) There is no <hi>Mother</hi>-Church to be accounted of, but <hi>one</hi> only; the Spouſe of Chriſt expreſſed by name in Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.

that's paid in Heaven: as <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to walk with God, the times being ſo corrupt, he had none elſe to walk with here. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <p>But when God doth bleſs a Nation, with guides and deputies under him, the chiefeſt heed and duty of the Soul (wherein her wiſdom or folly before God and man, and her ſelf appears) is in her chuſing, and cleaving to her <hi>true</hi> guide, and ſuperiour, and not the <hi>wrong;</hi> for by miſtake herein, the rights and honour of the <hi>true</hi> Superiour, and repreſentative of Chriſt, ſhall be Sacrilegiouſly with-held, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely conferred on the <hi>falſe,</hi> which is her caſe and fate in every ſin, that engroſſes her affections, where the honour that's due to God alone, is paid to an Idol, for want of heed and difference to be made, between what is her real, and that which is only her ſeeming good, and lure to deceive her.</p>
               <p>And the Errour, that may be commited in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of wrong Superiours over us, under Chriſt, in <hi>External</hi> matters of Religion, (For in <hi>Internals,</hi> or <hi>externals</hi> there is none to be over us, but himſelf,) is twofold; either (1) In <hi>ſpecie,</hi> in kind, or (2.) <hi>gradu,</hi> in degree. The firſt, is a miſtake in the <hi>whole;</hi> as if a Subject of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould take the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for his <hi>Soveraign;</hi> in ſuch a caſe, his obedience to the wrong, is Treaſon againſt the right Superiour, and is not his obedience, but his ſin: the miſtake in <hi>degree,</hi> is between <hi>Superiour</hi> and <hi>Subordinate;</hi> where reſpect and obedience is due to both, but the reſpect that's due to the Maſter, is given to the Servant, and the Steward honoured above the Lord, and the Officer, above the Prince, that Authorizes him, which is the uſual honour of thoſe, that make <hi>blind obedience</hi> and advantage, more than <hi>conſcience,</hi> the meaſure of their duties.

and faulty, for the <hi>firſt,</hi> is liker <hi>madneſs</hi> and diſtraction, one purblin'd in his Intellects may be guilty of the one, but none can be guilty of the other, but him, who is wholly blind, and mad. For God and nature directs men, and Chriſtians, and Irrational Creatures themſelves, to make a difference between Friends and ſtrangers, and though to be civil to all, yet not to rely, and truſt on thoſe we know not, as much, as on thoſe we know. The word <hi>Hoſtis</hi> for an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, at firſt did ſignifie a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> ſo eaſy is the tranſition that is between them: and in Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, which is our preſent caſe, God hath given great Inſtances to the world in general, and to all Nations in particular, that it is not his will, we ſhould be led by ſtrangers, more than by guides of our own fleſh and bloud: for this cauſe, Chriſt took upon him humane nature, when ſent by God, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. to direct the world; <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels</hi> for this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. which though greatly <hi>Holy,</hi> is yet <hi>Forraign</hi> to ours; and, as it were of another Country, and their beſt meſſages ſeldome received, by the beſt Chriſtians, without fear, and horrour, and ſuſpition Luk. 2.9. Math. 28.45. <hi>But he took upon him the ſeed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>being ſent unto his own,</hi> John. 1.11. <hi>And in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren to be the better</hi> fitted for <hi>Sympathy</hi> towards us on <hi>his</hi> part, and the <hi>belief</hi> thereof on <hi>ours. Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. In like manner, in ſending his Apoſtles for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Nations, the firſt fruits in every Nation, that were converted to Chriſt, were appointed for Biſhops and Teachers, as ſoon as might be, to convert their Brethren, and the Supemacy over the Gentile Churches, not entail'd upon a Jewiſh line and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion forever, as our firſt Teachers; but upon the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41014:58"/>
Natives themſelves, in every City and Country, when fitted for it, to Govern and direct their people; and every Province to have its own Metropolitan, chief within it ſelf, and unſubordinate to Foreigners. And it is likewiſe obſerved, that the needs of every Country in point of food, and Raiment, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, is beſt ſupplied from within it ſelf; and whether it be for the health, or intereſt of this Nation, to delight to wear forraign Liveries above its own, I ſhall not now diſpute; and, but that the Witchcraft and faſcination, that is in errour, doth Seal up the Intellect, it deludes; leſs diſpute there would be with all ſober minds, but that we have Governours of our <hi>own</hi> Nation (praiſed be God) fitted as likely for ability and compaſſion, to be faithful guides to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Brethren, as the greateſt Angels of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> to whom (were it alwayes certain, they would prove good Angels) we are not ſo near and dear, as to our own Paſtors, who are bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh. And that our own wiſe Kings and Parliaments, have, and can, make as wholeſom Laws for this Church and State, as the Conclave ever can or did, how far, and how dear ſoever fetched and bought.</p>
               <p>To alledge, as the Romaniſts do, that Chriſt had his fix'd Officers, his Apoſtles, and Biſhops in his Church, before there were any Chriſtian Kings, which cannot be denyed; that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the chief of theſe Apoſtles, which alſo may be granted, for peace-ſake, as to his <hi>precedence,</hi> but not any <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> that the preſent Popes are the ſucceſſors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in all his Authority and Holineſs, whether they follow him, as he followed Chriſt, or not; and therefore are Superiours to all Chriſtian Kings and Princes, in their own Teritories, as well as at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:41014:58"/>
in all affairs relating to Religion, is ſuch a broken Title, ſuch a far-fetch'd Etymology, and derivation of Authority, as only fully proves the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian humour of exalting themſelves, above every thing that is called God, or <gap reason="foreign">

And clear, firſt it is, that the <hi>Presbyters labour,</hi> as a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> under Chriſt, in his word and Sacraments, is within the Vineyard of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore belonging to <hi>Eternity,</hi> as the Church it ſelf doth; and that the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the ſecond place, is <hi>Temporal</hi> by conſequence, and about <hi>order</hi> in this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> world; and the better preſervation of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> out-ſide of the Church; for to affirm it to be a <hi>Spiritual Rule</hi> over the Church in its <hi>in-ſide,</hi> (which is Eternal, and Chriſts own Peculiar Juriſdiction,) were very inconvenient and unſound. And this <hi>Temporal Superiority</hi> over the <hi>Temporal</hi> part of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Community, as to all Cauſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that be within it, (for any Society whether Sacred or Civil, can no more ſubſiſt, or fare well, without a Governour or a Chief, than a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head) continues in <hi>Biſhops,</hi> by Chriſts eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the riſing of the Sun; that is, till the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate of that Province become Chriſtian;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41014:65"/>
whoſe defect they before ſupplied, as Guardians; and then it doth ſet, or ceaſe, but <hi>Heliacally,</hi> as the Stars ſet in the morning, in deference to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luſtre, that is better able to do their work, continuing ſtill in the ſame firmament and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> under his Rayes, and Bound nevertheleſs by their office and duty, to be ready to ſhine again without him, (as before) in caſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Eclipſe, as was ſaid before. And it well appears how the Chriſtian Temporal Magiſtrates, and the Church have underſtood one another, in reference to their ſeveral bounds and limits, by thoſe parcels of Eccleſiaſtical Authority the one hath reſum'd, as his right, and the other wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly quitted and yeilded thereunto as juſt, upon his arrivall to Supremacy in Church, as well as ſtate. For we never find him offering to touch any part of the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> office or the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> nor to preach, or Baptize, or abſolve, or conſecrate, which acts and Authorities belong to another <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom, farr enough out of his <hi>Temporal</hi> Dominion and Juriſdiction. But ſeveral parts of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Rule and Government, have been rightly aſſum'd and yielded to him in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Counſels, and in our Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, wherein he is declared ſupreme in all Cauſes and over all perſons Eccleſiaſtical, which was the Original Right of Metropolitans, but ſince held by them, as was fit, not as <hi>Soveraigns</hi> any more but as <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to their Chriſtian Magiſtrates. And by this Hypotheſis, is reſolvable, whether <hi>Biſhops</hi> ordain <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as they are <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or as they are <hi>Rulers,</hi> which would make for the ſtrength and re-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance of the Proteſtant Intereſt: For <hi>Biſhops</hi> cannot Ordain of themſelves, without <hi>Prieſts</hi> to aſſiſt, much
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41014:66"/>
leſs can <hi>Prieſts</hi> Ordain without a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to preſide, where he may be had; and Chriſtian Kings offer not to reſume (as their temporal right) any part of the Ordination or Conſecration of either ſort, but only nominate our <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the right of Patrons or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or as <hi>repreſenters</hi> of the whole <hi>Community,</hi> by <hi>whom</hi> they were in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> elected, as likewiſe in the <hi>Brittiſh.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who is but a <hi>Labourer,</hi> is <hi>Inferiour</hi> and ſubordinate in <hi>this World</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who is a <hi>Ruler,</hi> by <hi>Divine Order</hi> and deſignation, not to be violated by any, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>guilt</hi> and ſcandal of being <hi>Rebells</hi> againſt <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</hi> And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his <hi>Chair</hi> as a <hi>Ruler,</hi> is <hi>Inferiour</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi> in his <hi>Pulpit,</hi> as Chriſts <hi>Labourer</hi> and <hi>Preacher,</hi> in reference to the <hi>other</hi> World. For it is a higher excellency to be the <hi>leaſt</hi> in <hi>Eternity,</hi> than the <hi>greateſt</hi> in <hi>time,</hi> to ſubdue <hi>ſin</hi> than to ſubdue the <hi>World, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. Which yet, is ſo, as to <hi>Faith,</hi> and reaſon, and the Conſciences of all ſober men, with their own; yet not as to <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>courſe</hi> of this <hi>preſent</hi> life, and general Practice; whereby through humane infirmity very few, (yet not wanting in our times,) have been obſerved to be as ambitious of the <hi>labour</hi> of Converting Souls, as of the <hi>honour</hi> and command of a Rich Biſhoprick; though the worſt (and <hi>Welſey</hi> himſelf) at their dying hour have yielded to this Truth: Whereby no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> Miniſter, that is diligent in his work and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, can have reaſon to <hi>envy</hi> the higher condition and temporal honours of Superiours in this World, having ſuch great reward and honour in reſerve from God, for his own work.

               <p>And were not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the only <hi>Maſter</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, and Judge, and King; and his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> but in the Character and Condition of <hi>Labourers</hi> and Stewards under him, and not the <hi>Lords</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of his bleſſed word and Myſteries; <hi>who</hi> were <hi>able</hi> or ſufficient, to <hi>requite</hi> their ſpirituals? Is the tenth of an Eſtate, or thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl, or the whole World (were one ſole owner of it) a ſufficient price or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for the Goſpel, or for Chriſt, or for pardon of ſins, and peace of Conſcience, and the Souls Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What Kings or Emperours were too good to bow, and proſtrate themſelves before <hi>Popes,</hi> (if they preach'd) or any right Miniſter of the Goſpel, were their comfortable meſſages their own, and not their Heavenly Maſters? Yet though they are but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſervants under Chriſt, are they not to be left without honour, and eſteem, and maintenance from men, and that not mean or ſcant, for their work ſake; though they be to expect their full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and portion from none, but God. For the reaſon and Civility of Nations, (though they reſerve the Glory and honour to the chief Authors of their deliverances and victories,) yet leaves not the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of good Tydings without their due reſpect and preſents. God alone is our ſupream King, and Father, preſerver, and our Earthly Superiours, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41014:67"/>
Benefactors, and Delieverers, are but Inſtruments under him: And though the <hi>reſpect</hi> that is due and congruous to the <hi>principal,</hi> be not payable to the <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> yet by all Laws, and Inſtincts of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Conſcience, and Cuſtomes of Nations, Inſtruments under God of Benefits, Kings, Fathers, Conquerours, Benefactors, receive that proper and meet acknowledgment and return, that is their due; yet Inſtruments are by no means to ſtep into the <hi>Throne,</hi> or uſurp or arrogate the <hi>Royalties</hi> of their <hi>Principals,</hi> but muſt reſt content with that Tribute of reſpect and honour, that is due to their <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Ranks and Stations, though they are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers under God of Spiritual, which infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all temporal benefits and mercies.</p>
               <p>And great and remarkable is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Pains</hi> of the Clergy, and the <hi>payments</hi> and rewards of the <hi>Laity,</hi> in the <hi>Ancient</hi> and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>heart,</hi> and the <hi>World leſs,</hi> towards what it is, and hath been, in the degenerate times of Chriſtianity, when the <hi>World</hi> began to have more of mens <hi>hearts,</hi> than <hi>Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> though the Prince of the Apoſtles, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our great and Wealthy <hi>Popes,</hi> was not worth a Groat upon the ſcore of his Function; for ſo is his anſwer to one begging his Alms, <hi>Silver and Gold have I none, but ſuch as I have give I thee,</hi> Act. 3.6. And yet all Rich Chriſtians then, that had either Land, or Houſes, ſold and parted with all, and laid them at his feet, <hi>c.</hi> 4.34, 35, 37. ſo great was the <hi>clearneſs</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>gratitude</hi> of the other, and the care and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence of the Community and of the poor in both. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured night and day to get his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while he preach'd the Goſpel of God unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9.

A good Argument, that they that would not ſpare their <hi>Eyes,</hi> much leſs would ſpare their <hi>Purſes</hi> for his ſake; as others more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cannot erect Temples, (though miracles of the World for magnificence) ſufficiently anſwerable to the merits of his memory. And the Apoſtolical ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence was cloſely followed by the ſucceeding <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Primitive Church: As <hi>Origen</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who preferr'd <hi>Hearts</hi> before <hi>Purſes,</hi> and fared hard, and went barefoot, while they had Nobles for their Converts, which is not to be attributed to Sullenneſs, or Melancholly, or Vain-glory, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſtrict obſervation of our Saviours Rule, <hi>Freely have you received, freely give,</hi> more binding in thoſe times of Miraculous aſſiſtance: Or to an aime of trampling this preſent World under their their feet, and encouraging their Chriſtian followers in their poverty and perſecutions, as the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> us'd to walk bare-head in ſnow and rain, to haſten the tardy March of his Armies: Or to the Eternal Rules and decencies of <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which require the <hi>one</hi> part to <hi>forget</hi> their <hi>merits,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> never to <hi>forget</hi> their <hi>benefits;</hi> more lively exerted in them, who by extraordinary Grace were better fitted to repreſent the ſeveral <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the life; whereof the <hi>Giver</hi> is ever <hi>one,</hi> as the <hi>Receiver</hi> is of the <hi>Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Receiver,</hi> (when he <hi>requites</hi> and repayes) puts on again the <hi>Giver,</hi> and the <hi>Giver</hi> becomes as a <hi>Creature</hi> to be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to receive, (which is a remarkable ſhadow and footſtep in nature of the Incarnation) and <hi>both parts</hi> of <hi>God</hi> could not be acted <gap reason="foreign">

And no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Miniſters of his Religion, without deſpiſing

               <p>But now far otherwiſe is it amongſt Chriſtians, Teachers and Diſciples, when the <hi>world</hi> hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their <hi>hearts;</hi> And Chriſt dwells but at their tongues only? many there are beſides <hi>Quakers,</hi> it is to be feared, that would be well contented to be without any <hi>Goſpel</hi> at all, on condition to be <hi>Tith-free;</hi> and judge no ſort of men better to be ſpared or retrenched in this Commonwealth than Chriſts Miniſters. And if they had Power enough in their hands, would judge an 100 <hi>l. per annum</hi> to be revenew enough, or two much, for any Biſhop to ſupport himſelf, and Family, and to keep Hoſpitality, and relieve the poor, and ſtrangers, and to defend the Church againſt its Enemies, and not 10000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> too much for themſelves, to ſpend upon their luſts and Vanity. And in ſome Nations, the Lay ſort Raign and Rule, and the Clergy hold the ſtirrup, or ſerve under revocable pay, like other workmen, and trained thereby to be, as obſervant of the ſtate, as of God; neither hath the <hi>degenerate Clergy</hi> been behind in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching, to the <hi>degenerate Laity,</hi> in grudging and ſubducting; eſpecially in the Roman Church, who conceived ſhe never had <hi>enough,</hi> untill ſhe had <hi>all,</hi> not only their <hi>Lands,</hi> but their <hi>Liberties,</hi> and all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41014:69"/>
became her Tenants or Vaſſals, or tributaries from the Plow to the Throne. Now, how would theſe two contrary luſts tear and deſtroy one another, if God had not raiſed Kings to preſerve the peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? How would Religion and good lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature all fall to the ground, and Atheiſm and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, or equivalent Ignorance and ſuperſtition, come again in their place, if Kings were not Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers to ſecure their Rights, and Defenders of the Faith, to maintain their Priviledges and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? to correct on the one hand the Idolatrous Avarice of ſome hard hearts who would ſtarve the Lord Chriſt, to cheriſh their Lord <hi>Mammon;</hi> And to check the Hypocriſie and worldlineſs of others, on the other hand, who <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>-like carry Chriſt upon their backs, to begg mens hearts; who make uſe of Purgatory, and the world to come, to gull men out of this preſent; who call all <hi>men</hi> to be their Paymaſters for the unvaluable unrequitable <hi>myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> (which they at beſt but counterfeit) and make them <hi>Vaſſals</hi> for ever afterward, upon the ſcore of that Tribute and acknowledgement; who claim a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over <hi>Princes,</hi> not upon the ſcore of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and the Eternal obligations thereof, which they <hi>quit,</hi> but upon the ſcore of their <hi>Chairs,</hi> which was <hi>borrowed</hi> from the <hi>Throne,</hi> and intended it ſhould return to its ſubordination thereunto.

that <hi>Preach</hi> it, but their <hi>Maſters</hi> rather. It is an ill and Un-evangelical Inference, and too much ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antichriſt, from Spiritual Doctrines to raiſe Secular Superiority, and to make wordly Rule and Ambition, the chief end of the everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> was a perfidious Traiterous crime in <hi>Wolſey,</hi> to transfer his Maſters honour and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty upon himſelf, which is their great Diſeaſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſtant Boldneſs upon Chriſt. A Purſiveant, though ſent from a King, to Arreſt a Peer, is not Superiour in quality thereby to the Peer, although his Authority and errand be; we may as well conclude all <hi>Centinels</hi> to be <hi>Generals</hi> of the Field, or every <hi>Chaplain</hi> declaring Chriſt will in a Sermon before the King, to be <hi>Primate</hi> of the Church, and every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who <hi>Conquers</hi> the world by his <hi>Faith,</hi> to be <hi>Emperour</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> as Popes to be Supremes in Chriſtian Kingdoms and Churches over mens ſouls and bodies, becauſe they are the Servants and Officers of Chriſt, who is. When St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> boldly durſt ſuſpend his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> meekely yielded to the cenſure of his <hi>Subject;</hi> there was no <hi>Superiority</hi> either <hi>loſt</hi> or got, by this in either; both doing their parts of <hi>Servants</hi> herein, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of fidelity about his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s myſteries, the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> of <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to his <hi>Saviours</hi> Steward.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41014:70"/>
in addition to their Civil obligation, which is correlative to their Civil Superiority; for as we are Chriſtians, we ſerve none but Chriſt: and thoſe that Rule and Govern, if Chriſtians, do it as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and Pious Kings have juſtly eſteemed it to be a greater Dignity to be <hi>Servants</hi> of Chriſt, than <hi>Soveraignes</hi> of this <hi>world.</hi> Whoſoever therefore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guides, or miſ-governs his Inferiour, or wrongs, or deceives his Neighbour, or diſobeys, or diſhonours his Superiour, Chriſtian: violates his Faith and duty, firſt to his Heavenly Soveraign in his heart, before he wrongs any other on Earth, by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act. And it is our concern and honour, as to detect and ſhun all ſuch as are Traytors and Faithleſs to our Saviour, ſo dearly to embrace and love them from our hearts that are true.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41014:85"/>
the <hi>Popes</hi> anſwer is <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and Orthodox, that the King is Chriſts Vicar in his Kingdom, and the head of the Church, which he may well Govern with his own Authority without depending upon Forreign: provided he took along the Law of God, and the opinion of his ſages, for his Rule and help; the advice to be theirs, the Acts of Governing to be his own; which with the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is unſound and Heretical Doctrine; for, it's the Land that moves with ſome, and not themſelves, when they are ſailing from it. And it appears by event, the Popes did never intermeddle in the Government of this Church or State: yea, that they were ſuch ſtrangers to us all along, to the time of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who ſent <hi>Auſtine</hi> hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by his queſtions and clinches about the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he met at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Market, <hi>Angli, Angeli: Deira, Dei ira;</hi> King <hi>Elle,</hi> Halelujah; it appears: whether we were <hi>Pagans,</hi> or Chriſtians here in <hi>Brittain,</hi> he did not very well know; but ſome Papiſts are grown wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of late, to relinquiſh this part of their pretence; and to allow this Epiſtle to be counterfeit (becauſe ſo contrary to their preſent Doctrines, and ſeditious principles, more than for the conſiderable reaſons Sir <hi>H.

For the end is better than the means, and the Maſter than the Servant, and the Building than
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41014:88"/>
the Scaffold: And this preſent World, (<hi>Satans</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) is more excellent than ſuch a Church, which is wholly deſigned and dedicated to ſerve and gain it; with all, the end gives name and being and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition unto the means, as a ſum of Money, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to relieve the poor, is Charity; to pay Debts, Juſtice; to Bribe an Evidence, Perjury; to hire an Aſſaſinate, Murder: or a Building made to dwell in, is a Houſe; to Grind Corn, a Mill; to keep off Enemies, a Fort; to ſerve God in, a Church; to buy and ſell in, a Shop: and by conſequence that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (that hath Earthly Rule and advantage, for its chief end, and profeſſes Earth thereby to be better than Heaven, and Goſpel good for nothing more, than to fill Coffers) cannot be call'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or true Catholick Religion, (for the chief aime of ſuch, is the World to come) but rather an Antichriſtian trade or craft, which ſets Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Truth, and Sacraments, all at ſale, to make ſure of this.

               <p>IN the third place, to come to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Monkes</hi> Impreſſion upon our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church; we are to examine, whether being free born, ſhe forfeited that liberty by any foul Hereſie or Schiſme? Or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time merited Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over her, by being a more Excellent and purer Church? Or by any Act of redemption, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requitable Courteſie, (which ſwallows liberty) hath won, or oblig'd it in juſtice and equity, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to her? Or wherein her Title to this Supremacy lay, in its firſt advance, and ſetting out, before any pretence, or colour from preſcription or poſſeſſion. The Face therefore and Phyſiognomy of both Churches, at that time, is to be viewed and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its lines and features, which of the two for Doctrine and Diſcipline, and Traditions, was moſt Catholick, and Apoſtolick, and Primitive, and Merited (ſuppoſing their years and ſtanding equal) to Rule and give Law to the other. Where it is to be premiſed, and taken for granted out of <hi>Bede,</hi> that the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> and <hi>Pictiſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Churches, were then one and the ſame exactly, in Principles and Cuſtomes, with their Mother the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church; and what is delivered of the one, belongs to the other; yea the Daughters were more hot and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

And refus'd to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Saxons:</hi> And the great ſore of all at the bottom, becauſe they would not owne <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf to be an Archbiſhop, denying by conſequence the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy who ſent him. <hi>Bede</hi> out of his moderation, conjectures the cauſe of their Errour about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to be this, [<hi rend="sup">d</hi>] <hi>ut pote quibus longe ultra orbem poſitis,</hi> &amp;c, being ſituated out of the reſt of the World, the decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> about the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> had not reach'd them, only what works of Piety and Purity, were to be learnt out of the Writings of the Prophets and Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtles, they made it their chief care and diligence to obſerve and practice.

this Errour, as were none of the Ancient Fathers, or Councils who took Scripture for their only Rule; and <hi>Gildas</hi> after their manner, hath ſcarce one Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph in his Epiſtle, unſtor'd therewith; and one of his chief lamentations in <hi>Diocletian's</hi> Perſecution is, for their Bibles being burnt in the publick Markets, which kind of ſight our Apoſtate Modern <hi>Roman-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> would have been content to behold in larger manner, with dry eyes. And that they were not in any Errour, or ignorance of the Decrees of Synods, about this point, appears from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great his Epiſtle, and Certificate in their behalf before mention'd, and the preſence of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops in the great Council of <hi>Arles</hi> determining this particular Controverſy about <hi>Eaſter.</hi>

If he be meek and lowly, it is very likely, he bears that yoke himſelf, and would have you to bear the ſame; but if he be rigorous and proud, it's manifeſt, he is not of God, and you need not care for his meſſage.

               <p>Theſe <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> premiſed, I come to <hi>Poſitive</hi> proofs for the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that it was by <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Miniſtry, and not by <hi>Roman:</hi> For ſome of our Incomparably Learned Writers give it almoſt for graunted (though they ſufficiently fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inconvenience) that our <hi>Engliſh Chriſtians</hi> ſtand not ſo ſecure from the danger of this <hi>Romiſh</hi> pretention, as the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> do. <q>For the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops ſayes the great and good D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hammond</hi>

out againſt this pretention, and that with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide, if the title of converſion, which the Romaniſt pleads for our ſubjection, may be of any validity with him, it muſt needs follow that the <hi>Whole Iſland,</hi> cannot upon this ſcore of <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> converſion, be now deemed <hi>ſchiſmatical;</hi> it being <hi>certain</hi> that the whole Iſland, and particularly the <hi>Dominion of Wales,</hi> was not thus converted by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> nor formerly by any ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> or that obſerved the Roman Order, (as appears by the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> contrary ro the uſage receiv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi>) but either by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> as our Annals tell us, moſt probably. And this in the firſt place muſt needs be yielded by thoſe that expect to receive any advantage by this argument.</q> But, which is more, if the <hi>Whole Iſland,</hi> as well as the <hi>Dominion of Wales,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sees, may be equally proved to have had their converſion from <hi>Other</hi> hands, and not from <hi>Rome;</hi> it may ſeem worth while to ſhew this, becauſe it will fully ſtop the mouth of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to this brag, and quite <hi>remove</hi> all imputation and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Schiſm</hi> out of doors.</p>
               <p>And the poſitive proofs for this, may be rank'd under two heads, (1,) For a <hi>pure</hi> Converſion, (2.) a <hi>Mixt.</hi> By the firſt I mean, a Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, by men men of <hi>Brittiſh Extraction</hi> and <hi>Deſcent,</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſſent</hi> to the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its other errours; that is, by <hi>Brittains only,</hi> without the aſſiſtance of any other Nation in this work.

                  <hi>SECTION X.</hi> That all or moſt of the Kingdoms and Churches in this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their firſt Faith from <hi>Brittain,</hi> yet <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> pretends to no Supremacy over them upon that account, and the Romaniſts <hi>Feloes de ſe</hi> in that kind of Plea.</head>
               <p>IF the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no better evidence for her propagation of the Faith, (and Supremacy thereby, over other Churches of the world) than is produc'd for <hi>Brittain,</hi> it is plain and eaſy to diſcern, its title is not founded in any <hi>reality</hi> or merit, but a <hi>diſeaſe</hi> of the fancy only; and that <hi>high-mindedneſs,</hi> whereof ſhe was early forwarn'd by her rejected Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. or a malady like that of the Athenian Merchant, who imagin'd all the Ships that arrived at Harbour to be his own: whoſe cure from this diſtemper had been their imaginary beggery and undoing. The <hi>French</hi> Church at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> or the <hi>Lutheran</hi> amongſt us, might far better pretend to a Primacy over <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and Learned, and better underſtood by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral that reſort to them, and acting with the leave of our Province, and its Lawful Governours, and not ſiding Barbarouſly with Pagan Enemies againſt Chriſtian Brethren, to deſtroy or adulterate the true Faith, as did Monk <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> who at leaſt could be but <hi>Rector</hi> of Chriſt-Church <hi>Canterbury,</hi> under his <hi>mighty</hi> Patron <hi>Ethelbert</hi> in defiance of his <hi>rightful</hi> Metropolitan <hi>Theonus;</hi> which yet he could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>himſelf,</hi> for want of the <hi>tongue,</hi> nor by any other,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41014:161"/>
by reaſon of the <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Irregularity. Or, to ſuppoſe more than can be asked or expected, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi> who was King of <hi>Kent</hi> only, was King alſo of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and the Eaſt, and the South, and Weſt-Saxons, and compleate Lord over the whole Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> which then reached from <hi>Humber,</hi> to <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and now further, over <hi>Wales;</hi> and that he in ſuch a right, had lawfully nominated and elected our <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for his Arch-Biſhop, who thereupon had been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Conſecrated and Inſtall'd by the Clergy of the Province, according to the Canons of the Church, and by the conſent and voluntary Ceſſion of <hi>Theonus</hi> his predeceſſor, without the help of Heathen force, yet <hi>Theonus</hi> in that caſe could but reſign his <hi>Term,</hi> but not the <hi>rights</hi> of his Church forever; and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereby but a more lawful <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhop, of an Intruding Roman Monk. For ſuch a ſettlement by the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, did not change the See to be Roman, but conſtitute <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his ſucceſſors to be rather <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops. It's a whole Kingdom, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizes one Forreigner, and not one Forreigner a whole Kingdom; for ſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> let him that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to that Chair, be <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> or (which were enough to ſtupifie, and unſanctifie any head of a Church) let him be a Witch, or a Sodomite, or an Atheiſt, the vertue of the Roman Chair nevertheleſs ſhall naturalize, and Purifie, and <hi>Petrifie</hi> this ſtrange man into a right <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick</hi> Pope and ſucceſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Holy and Infallible, notwithſtanding thoſe forreign diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. Therefore by their own rule, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his ſucceſſors were frail <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops at beſt, and and hell'd all their Priviledges and Precedencies in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41014:161"/>
that See, in the right of their <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Chair, and not their <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſion. And what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts ſoever they made <hi>de facto,</hi> to erect and prefer that See in <hi>Roman</hi> Right, before all the Ancient and ſtanding See's of <hi>Brittain,</hi> they were all Null, and Void, and of ſuch Schiſmatical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and impoſſibility, as were the like Act of any <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pope, that ſhould go about to raiſe the Chair of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Toledo,</hi> from whence he came, above the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Order appeals from this to thoſe, than which in their Principles, nothing could be more Heretical, and ſinful, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. If it be offer'd, that the Superiority here acquir'd by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> was acquir'd for <hi>Rome</hi> from whence he came, by the ſame reaſon the Supremacy at <hi>Rome</hi> was acquir'd for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from whence St. <hi>Peter</hi> came, and that Church to be reviv'd; and <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Churches, alike deſcending, to be made ſubject to it, and by conſequence to be a Siſter, not a Mother to our <hi>Brittain,</hi> and a younger Siſter, too, under their common Mother of <hi>Sion:</hi> But this point hath been ſolemnly determined by Popes themſelves, in the Controverſy between <hi>Dole</hi> and <hi>Tours:</hi> Which laſt from the beginning was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Metropolis of <hi>Little-Brittain;</hi> till <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> (or St. <hi>David</hi>

and of the Pall he thence brought with him; or, as Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> judge afterwards in the Caſe, ſuggeſts, (which makes this Preſident more to fit) becauſe the <hi>Brittains</hi> having about that time erected a new King to themſelves againſt <hi>France,</hi> they took the occaſion of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s arrival to erect a new Archbiſhoprick likewiſe.

                  <hi>Hoveden</hi> ſtiles it, came at laſt to be decided before Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who, out his moderation, firſt propos'd an expedient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may be ſure <hi>Rome</hi> was to be no looſer: That <hi>Dole</hi> ſhould continue an Archbiſhoprick, with two ſuffragans only, and receive a Pall from <hi>Rome</hi> by the hands of <hi>Tours,</hi> whoſe right it was to be Primate; but the <hi>Dolenſians</hi> refuſing this offer, the Pope in the ſecond year of his Papacy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1199. determin'd for the <hi>Ancient</hi> Right of the <hi>Native,</hi> againſt 600 years <hi>preſcription</hi> and above, back'd with Princely Authority, for the <hi>Forreigner.</hi> So that if our Holy Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſuffer themſelves to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by that Golden Rule of doing as they would be done by, whereby all reaſonable and good men are governed, or ſtand to their own Principles and Deciſions, whereby the worſt and moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are concluded, they would no longer own this ſo weak and infirm pretence for Supremacy over our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Churches, but ſuffer the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their obedient Catholicks to be undeluded from this Impoſture forever.</p>
               <p>But they ought to be told that the Church of <hi>Brittain</hi> hath propagated the Faith over more Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe</hi> by her <hi>own,</hi> or by Diſciples of her own School and Inſtitution, than <note n="c" place="bottom">Uſher <hi>p.</hi> 530.</note>

By giving away Kingdoms from the right owners, to thoſe, that had Swords in their hands, to force and win them, upon the termes and condition, the Pope might be conſidered, for pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the name of Chriſt and Religion, to countenance ſuch injuſtice: So the Pope and Monk <hi>Auguſtine</hi> got their firſt footing in <hi>Canterbury</hi> by the help of the prevailing <hi>Saxons.</hi> Auguſtinus <hi>(quod</hi> Dinothus <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſit) praetextu fidei gentem advenam alieno confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit imperio, ut ſuam &amp; juriſdictionem</hi> Romanam <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lataret,</hi> ſaith one,<note n="a" place="bottom">Antiq.

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, (as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot Dunawd</hi> well perceived,) made uſe of Religion to Inveſt and ſettle a Foreign Nation in a Territory, that was not their own, to promote, and enlarge the better, their own Eccleſiaſtical<note n="b" place="bottom">Wheeloc <hi>note in</hi> Bede <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> Supremacy by that means. So have they ruin'd the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, and expos'd them to the <hi>Turk,</hi> about 140. years after, by giving <hi>Charlemagne</hi> the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, from its <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Proprietors, to be their Patron and deliverer from Lombards, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs;

ſo have they befool'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambition all along, ſetting him on the like deſignes with 88.

Aſſiſt ſo juſt a Cauſe, before any others whatſoever, according to <hi>Dido</hi>'s temper in the Poet, making the Caſe of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in Exile her own, <hi>Haud ignara mali miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> had no more Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal right and title to our <hi>Brittiſh Sees,</hi> how long ſoever Uſurped, than <hi>Cromwell</hi> had to the <hi>Brittiſh Crown.</hi> Whoever elſe may envy, or hinder, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine our recovery of our juſt freedom and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they, that through Gods mercy have had the like Reſtoration and deliverance, ought not either in Honour, or Civility, or Humanity to do it; (nor, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appear to have the greateſt ſhare and benefit therein,) without manifeſt hazard of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for by revolt to Popery Princes quit no leſs their external Supremacy in holy Church, (the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Jewel in their Crown,) than by Apoſtacy to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm; not more by the parity of the Idolatries, than by their own Act and Reſignation. For they cannot longer hold the ſame, in the <hi>Catholick-Roman,</hi> without being Excommunicate, as undutyful; and they let go their hold thereof in the <hi>Proteſtant Christian,</hi> by Excommunicating themſelves, as unkind and unwiſe. Nor, if after all this, they be found to Act both againſt Gods revealed will, and fate therein, or the ſecret Decrees, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſes of his Providence againſt it, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one was made as clear as the Sun before, and the other will afterwards appear as clear as the Moon, which is next unto it) can they ever be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to their own Church and Nation, out of vain glorious kindneſs to forreign cheats, without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God, as well as their friends, to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain overthrow and ruin, either Temporal or Eternal, or both, of the weaker ſide. Therefore the ſharp and ſearching judgement of the great Arch-Biſhop
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41014:196"/>
                  <hi>Bramhal,</hi> could ſoon eſpy, that the plea of the Antiquity and Independancy of our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church, in the Controverſy between us and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtrikes the cauſe dead forever, at one blow. Not that being exempt from the pretences of a Junior Church, (once animated with Empire to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her betters,) we are not bound nevertheleſs, to hold Communion with every good Church of Chriſt, where and when, we may, yea with <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, if it return'd to its Ancient purity, and ſubjection to our Saviour; as on the other hand, to ſhun others, as we do <hi>Rome,</hi> that were guilty of the like Corruption and Apoſtacy; which flight and diſtance, we are wont to obſerve in our moral, and natural Communion and converſe, as well as Chriſtian; embracing or ſhunning good, or evil Company, for our ſafety, or credit, as wholeſome or Peſtilential Air, for Health, as well as ſound and unſound Churches, out of Allegiance to Chriſt, our common Lord, or fear of ſcandal and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in their ſins and judgments, by our Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For our Communion, though it be our great <hi>duty,</hi> (as Schiſme is a great ſin,) yet it is not in our <hi>abſolute</hi> power and diſpoſe, in the <hi>general,</hi> without any other Rule or reaſon, to incline us to be of this, or that Church, but our own fancy and humour; no, we are acted by <hi>neceſſity</hi> in great part therein; for it is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> tye upon us, to <hi>embrace</hi> good, and <hi>relinquiſh evil,</hi> and corrupt Communion; and to be guided by <hi>Chriſts</hi> will, and not our <hi>own,</hi> as our rule and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard: and to ſhun all, whom his word Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates, and to communicate with all, whom his word approves: For to <hi>approve,</hi> whom Chriſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> whom Chriſt <hi>approves,</hi> is not in the <hi>power</hi> of any Chriſtian, that <hi>ownes</hi> Chriſt for his <hi>Soveraign:</hi> All the part that we have in our own
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41014:197"/>
power, is the exerciſe of every mans <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>private judgment,</hi> under the guidance of Chriſts rule, (which they hate the leaſt mention of at <hi>Rome,</hi> as impious and Haeretical, and leading to a private ſpirit, the root of all evil errours in the Church,) and comparing the lives and ſtate of Chriſtians and Churches, by this general rule of Chriſt, and this particular eye of our Souls, to put our Communion in execution, according to Chriſts mind; and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his friends, and to ſhun his enemies, and to like and diſlike, as we are to do all our other Affairs, in him, from our hearts, according to my Text. For let there be no private judgment to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private good or evil, or between the guides themſelves, we are to truſt, then <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall paſs for as good a Prophet, as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Alcharon be equal to the Bible, for to the blind all colours are the ſame. But regulated <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit,</hi> wherein God himſelf ſpeaks, (who is greater than all the World,) where it is kept pure from Worldly ends, and Idols; for <hi>nothing</hi> is more publick and Catholick, than <hi>Conſcience,</hi> or reaſon, or right, or duty, or holineſs, or juſtice, which are ſynonymous, and carry univerſality, and eternity in their conceptions, by reaſon of the Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and Authority, they partake, and anſwer to. And nothing conſtitutes more a <hi>private Spirit,</hi> than private ends and carnal deſigns, and ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and profit, and filthy lucre, made chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, in duties, Doctrines, and Religions, with which Worldly, and ſordid mixtures the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith in all its parts, is too well known, to abound; which unworthy copulations are diſcernable by the weakeſt judgments, and condemn'd and hated by the moſt univerſal ſuffrages, and cenſures of God and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41014:197"/>
men: An Infant can diſcerne them in his neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nurſe, an Elephant in his unjuſt Feeder, Clownes in States-men and Politicians, and are abhorr'd and declaim'd againſt, by Heathen Philoſophers in their Schools, and Chriſtian in Pulpits, and are thoſe moral wild beaſts, that all Laws, humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and right Diſcipline, and education, and all rules of honour are mainly bent to diſcover, and hunt, and chaſe out of all Societies, and converſe, and hearts. Beſides a private <hi>Conſcience,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all its converſe according to <hi>Chriſts mind,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and direction, and doing nought that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed by him, is <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> by fiction, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated, and acted, and defended; which is as far from a private Spirit, as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> from the ends and <hi>luſts</hi> of <hi>man:</hi> It being not more natural and congruous in Chriſt himſelf, to delight in good men, and to abhorre the Congregations of the wicked, and carnal, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, than it is for his faithful Servants, and Truſtees, and Repreſentatives, who bear their Maſters perſon, and concern, and holineſs upon them by ſuch a fiction, to expreſs and imitate by their own Communion, and election of Societies, the mind and Inclination of their Lord, and ſoon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, who are his Friends or Enemies, or Traitors and Loyal Subjects in his Kingdom; and vigorouſly and and indiſpenſably to embrace the one, and ſhun the the other; for Servants act according to an <hi>accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> truſt, the Maſter being <hi>Lord</hi> of his own <hi>rights,</hi> to remit or indulge, out of favour as he pleaſes; which is not lawful for the Servant to preſume. And this skill, and inſtinct, and <hi>ſhadows</hi> of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> judgment, to diſcerne friends from ſtrangers to their Maſters, is viſible in Domeſtick Creatures,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41014:198"/>
emblemes of fidelity, who are Courteous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but ſevere and unſociable to ſuch as are not ſo, till by converſe and familiarity, they prove their unity and friendſhip; and take away private judgment and diſcretion, the diſtinction and difference between faithful and unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Subjects, Chriſtians, Churches, wholly falls to the ground, and Chriſtians and Catholicks are ſet below the Irrational Creatures. And for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to blaſt <hi>good Conſciences,</hi> that find out its faults, as <hi>private Schiſmatical</hi> Spirits, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol their own <hi>Carnal deſignes,</hi> and Trade, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of godlineſs, as <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> holy, pure, and publick, and eternal, is too viſibly one of the uniform <hi>ſymptomes</hi> of their <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they confound <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and reconcile, yea change <hi>Mammon</hi> into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt into Mammon. Withall, equal and coordinate Churches, or Chriſtians, (as we now ſuppoſe <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Brittain</hi> to be,) are not judges of one another, (where they ſeparate from one another) for <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem,</hi> is a rule in Law, but act ſeverally therein according to their reſpective duties, and allegiance to their own liege, and Superiour, who is Chriſt the head, and judge of both, in the <hi>other</hi> World; and in <hi>this</hi> alſo, by a free and general Council, which both parts ought for peace, and unity, to ſubmit to, which thereby becomes Superiour to both, either by Divine Inſtitution, and cuſtom Eccleſiaſtical, or by their own conſent and agreement, as in the Caſe of Arbitrators. And accordingly ſuch general Synods have cenſur'd, and ſentenced, and Excommunicated perſons, Churches, Provinces, Prieſts, Biſhops, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and Popes themſelves, when they walk'd awry
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41014:198"/>
from Chriſt's Rule. As the firſt General Council at <hi>Nice</hi> againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> The ſecond at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of that See; The third at <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt <hi>Nestorius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Arch-Biſhop; the fourth at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> againſt <hi>Eutyches, Dioſcorus, &amp;c.</hi> Prieſts, and the fift at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> Biſhops, reviving Origens errours, and the ſixth, <hi>Oecumenical</hi> or general Council in <hi>Trullo</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> againſt other Biſhops; and amongſt them, againſt the <hi>whole Church of Rome,</hi> its Clergy, and Laity, for <hi>departing</hi> from the <hi>Catholick</hi> tradition of the Church, about their Saturday faſt, wherein the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Church was ever Orthodox, with the reſt of the Ancient Chriſtian World, as was ſhewed. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will allow of no Council, or Canons, or Fathers, that ſhall offer to check its er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, nor Scripture it ſelf, but with its own ſence, and Interpretation thereof, whereby it ſhall be ſure not to croſs its Intereſt. Being a manifeſt and notorious example therein, of diſobedience and Irregularity, to all its Superiours, and the moſt Schiſmatical Church in the Chriſtian World; for <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Spondan <hi>An.</hi> 692. <hi>n.</hi> 5.</note>cannot deny, that the Greek writers declare their ſence, that the breach of Communion between the Greeks or Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and the Latine or Weſtern Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was, upon the diſobedience of the Popes to yield, and ſubmit to the Council in <hi>Trullo,</hi> wherein it had all other Churches of the World, and the Canons of the Apoſtles of its ſide; and undoubted Apoſtolical tradition, mentioned in moſt of the Ancient Fathers, as<note n="b" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> cannot, and doth not deny. A Church therefore, that deſerves to be ſhun'd, and diſown'd as ſcandalous, for that, and its other innumerable
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41014:199"/>
corruptions and infamous Uſurpations, and groſs Idolatries, and particularly, its <hi>Blind Obedience</hi> and Implicit Faith, that allows and directs to put <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in <hi>man,</hi> the head and fountain of all its dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errours and ſuperſtitions, whereof all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with it, muſt be approvers and partakers, by the terms and Injunctions of its Communion, which requires them to be all receiv'd, as Catholick Articles and Doctrines; and all contrary Truths, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, as Hereſies; whereby it becomes impoſſible for any underſtanding ſober Chriſtian, to be at the ſame time, within her Communion and pale, and out of the curſe of God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.5, 20.</p>
               <p>Therefore it were loſt, and needleſs labour, as to them, or our ſelves, to go about to diſprove all their imputation, and charge of Schiſm againſt us, or to prove on the other hand, the lawfulneſs of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, and recovery of thoſe Rights, and Truths, whereof we were in juſt poſſeſſion heretofore, but were kept out, for ſome hundreds of years by force, and fraud, and its Un-chriſtian confederations with Infidels againſt us. It is as hopeleſs and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a labour, as to them, I ſay, as to read Lectures of honeſty and reſtitution to Thieves, and Robbers. Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Schiſmaticks being as Averſe to have their Idol er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours croſſed, and diſhonour'd, as right Chriſtians, their God and their Truth blaſphem'd. Neither were it wiſdom, or Prudence, or right thankfulneſs to God, in our ſelves, by ſuch diſcourſes to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubt, our manifeſt Rights, and Duties, and Gods mercy, and deliverance, being all as clear as the Sun. Such a fooliſh undertaking this were, as for the Royal party, as before was inſtanc'd, to make Apologies for his Majeſties return, and his right to reaſſume his Crown, againſt thoſe that kept him out

If they would have us return under an unjuſt yoak, they ought to give firſt an example, by returning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under one more juſt. Elſe how can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Counſels, or Challenges to be regarded, whileſt themſelves count it ridiculous, to do that right to others; which they expect from us to be done to them, to our own wrong.</p>
               <p>Therefore inſtead of proving the legality, I ſhall chuſe rather to admire the wonderful Providence of our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Reſtoration: And how God hath bleſſed ſuch our Princes with great ſucceſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that have ſincerely advanc'd the ſame ſpiritual freedom of their Church and Countrey; and hath blaſted and mulcted others, with trouble, and diſaſter, and loſs of ſtrength, and Territory, and honour, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:41014:200"/>
publick love, that have openly, or clandeſtinely, gone about to overthrow this great bleſſing of our Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; whoſe beginning many aſcribe to the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. as its accompliſhment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in great part, to that of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But if the Reſtoration of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Church and Nation be conſider'd in his firſt root and cauſe, (as all certain Science is ever by the cauſe,) The day-break of our deliverance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began in the miraculous, and fatal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of our Great, and Wiſe, and Magnificent Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. For then properly was this Church reſtored, when according to Ancient hopes, and expectations, the Ancient <hi>Brittains</hi> were in him reſtor'd to their <hi>Crown</hi> and Countrey: Who no doubt were Gods Ancient Church, and firſt new <hi>Iſrael</hi> within this Iſle, the ſeed and Reliques of the firſt Apoſtolick Plantation, who amidſt ſo many ſtormes, and Invaſions, that have drown'd the names and memories of other Nations, were kept up a <hi>diſtinct</hi> people, by his Providence, amidſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent enemies round about, as it were by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſtaſis, till the arrival of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. For ever ſince, the diſtinction of that people in Names, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Tenure, Manners, Laws, Cuſtomes, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by degrees, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Brittains</hi> are diſſolv'd into one, and the ſame Nation, and the charge and right of preſerving and enjoying their liberty and Reformation, devolv'd on both alike.</p>
               <p>For it cannot be well unobſerv'd, how in the deep Counſels of Gods Providence, true Religion, and the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Monarchy, like twins, have fallen, and riſen up together, hand in hand, being partners, by a kind of Sympathy, in the wounds and proſperity of one another. For when <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:41014:200"/>
                  <hi>Monk,</hi> firſt came in; the <hi>Brittiſh Monarchy</hi> was <hi>declining:</hi> And no ſooner this was up again in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s <hi>Perſon,</hi> but <hi>Popery</hi> like a Bucket, was to go down and vaniſh, (as it never could ſince, Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely attempt to get up, without great Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and hazards, and weakning of this Monarchy.) So that this Nation had the honour, and ſingular mercy, to be the <hi>firſt</hi> of all Nations, eſpecially <hi>Weſtern,</hi> in receiving the firſt Life, the firſt Wounds, the firſt Cure, in its Religion. It being the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that welcom'd Chriſtian Religion into its own Throne, under its Kings, the firſt that exalted it into the Throne of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when her Kings grew Emperors: The firſt oppoſer of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, (to its wound and glory,) in the beginning of its dark Raign, which laſted about 900 years, and the firſt partaker, and chief cauſe, under God, in the Reformation, and deliverance from it. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. being the morning Star, and tydings of this day-break, not only to <hi>Brittain,</hi> but to the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> For King <hi>Henry</hi> came in, 1485. and <hi>Martyn Luther</hi> began to ſhine in <hi>Germany,</hi> about thirty years after.

The Reſtoration

of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Religion haſtening after that of its <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as it were by providential fate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: for where elſe better to fix, the beginning of our Reformation, as it is generally ſtil'd, is hard to calculate. To make thoſe conſpicious events and Audible ſtirrs, that firſt accompanied it in the World, (by which the vulgar, that are led by ſence, are moſt guided) the ſtandard of its Originals, were to begin at the ſtreame, and not at the ſpring: to place it in the viſible alteration it ſelf, made by Laws in Parliament againſt Bulls, and Palls, and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Appeals, in 22.23, 24. <hi>Henry</hi> Eight, (by which Popery in <hi>England</hi> was quite knocked in the head) were to affirm, there is no day-light before Sun-riſing. Its more agreeable to reaſon therefore, to date it, <hi>à priori,</hi> from its firſt diſcernible cauſes, and deſigns, and dawnings. The <hi>change</hi> being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, the queſtion is, about the circumſtances of <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>Perſons,</hi> and firſt <hi>Authors?</hi> or, who were the firſt Inſtruments, either knowingly and deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or without their knowledge or intent, that were primarily ſubſervient to providence in this work? For that God himſelf in his providence, was the firſt cauſe, and Author of our Reſtoration, not in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, (as he is the cauſe of all events, he permits in the World;) but by particular purpoſe and deſign, appears by this, that it was not the firſt deſign or purpoſe of any other, that were imployed, as chief Inſtruments in it. And what men vigorouſly promote <hi>beſide</hi> their intention, and above their own belief of the poſſibility, cannot be attributed to themſelves, but to that fatall power, that controll'd and puſhed them on. For that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, had neither an Original inclination, nor any full confidence of Power, to make ſuch a ſtupendious change in the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:41014:203"/>
World, is evident from Hiſtory, and reaſon, and more from this conſideration, that though himſelf have given proof and example, (when Popery was infinitely ſtronger then now it is, and its Divine Impoſtures not ſo much detected, as ſince they have been by Proteſtant light, whereby its reputation, and main ſtrength, and Authority is ſlighted and under-valued in the World,) yet there is no Chriſtian King, or Emperour, this day in Europe, how high, or great, ſoever of power, or Spirit, that if he had a mind, and perſwaſion, or provocation, to do the like; that can or dare think himſelf able, to follow King <hi>Henry,</hi> by his own ſingle power; to ſhake off, a new <hi>Roman Empire, (revived</hi> in <hi>Popes,</hi> by a myſtery of iniquity, or an Antichriſtian Maskerade) and to Combat Spiritual wickedneſſes in Heavenly places, as it were, as he did, (without the ſpecial aid of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.) Beſides <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, never departed from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or Religion, but from its <hi>Court,</hi> and ſecular Supremacy over Kings; which could never belong to Religion, nor to Church-men; miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rably chaſtizing his Subjects, the laſt ten years of his life, on either hand; Papiſts for adhering to the one, and Proteſtants for departing from the other: But the Pope for all this, Excommunicates him, with that zeal and ſeverity, as if he had rejected both; for he beſt underſtood his own Religion and myſtery, and that both were contained in that one, which he deſerted; ſo we ſee, the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> which King <hi>Henry</hi> profeſſed in all its Points and Doctrines, was condemn'd as <hi>Hereſie</hi> in him, for his denyal of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Papall <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation;</hi> though it became better, a Vicar of Chriſt to wave his perſonal heights, and Punctillioes, out of Chriſtian humility, and ſelf-denyal, rather than baniſh ſo Orthodox, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

a King, from the Church of Chriſt, And the rather, he being in the right, wherein he differ'd from his holineſs; whereby it clearly appears, that the beſt <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> is but a <hi>Heretick</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> if he croſs the Popes Intereſt and Supremacy, as doth the King and Church of<note n="z" place="bottom">

                  <hi>France,</hi> to this day in great part. And indeed, there is no bar to mens ſouls from embracing Truth, and Proteſtancy, but this ſpiritual Tyranny of the Supremacy; for being entirely ſet free from this, the ſoul returns to Truth in time, even againſt the Power of Cuſtom and Education, as the Pope well perceived, and is known by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and hath before been touch'd. As the change could not be attributed to any firſt deſign in King <hi>Henry;</hi> much leſs to <hi>Wolſey,</hi> than whom perhaps, none yet <hi>Contributed more</hi> to the deſtruction of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor <hi>intended</hi> leſs: Nor to Biſhop <hi>Fox</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that introduc'd him, through his great favour in Court, for ſiding with the <hi>Inceſtuous Marriage,</hi> which was more a cauſe of the Reſtoration, than either; enabling <hi>Fox,</hi> to raiſe <hi>Wolſey,</hi> to deſtroy Popery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both their Wills; Nor did <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in the leaſt intend this change, as may be preſum'd, when he directed this Marriage, which the Pope for a large Sum approv'd, and diſpenſed, which was his fault and overthrow, and not ſo much the Kings, who by the Cuſtoms, and inſuperable ignorance of the Age, might ſincerely believe, that the Pope had really ſuch a Power, as he aſſumed, and Father'd upon God himſelf for his Author: ſeeing therefore there is ſo little of <hi>man's</hi> deſign, for this <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> in the very <hi>men</hi> themſelves, that were the Inſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but all appears to proceed from fate and

The Reference between the Model and the building; or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and the Iſſue; for a houſe, or an event, there begins, where theſe two begin to meet. (2.) A general belief that the Prophecy of the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Crown, was accompliſh'd in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and not ſo much in any other. (3.) The Sympathy and concomitancy ever between the <hi>Brittiſh Church</hi> and <hi>Crown,</hi> in their <hi>ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> and <hi>riſe.</hi> The firſt <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and inſtance therefore was in <hi>K.

The next appearing pulſe of ſome change for <hi>Brittiſh</hi> advantage, was the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Prince Arthur,</hi> and the deſign of his <hi>name,</hi> as the Hiſtorian obſerv'd, but <hi>God</hi> choſe another Inſtrument and <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,</hi> to bring this work to paſs, Prince <hi>Arthurs wife,</hi> a weaker veſſel, and the <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Marriage, which proved the main <hi>downfall</hi> of Popery.

But if the Church be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its <hi>Outſide,</hi> the Caſe is in <hi>another</hi> World, that is, in this <hi>preſent</hi> World; where the <hi>Civil</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is <hi>Supream,</hi> in all <hi>Temporal</hi> Concerns and Cauſes: As in all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> are Eccleſiaſtical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Governours; and that two wayes: 1. <hi>Originally.</hi> 2. <hi>Eminently. Originally,</hi> the rightful Biſhops of <hi>Brittain,</hi> before the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> being of Apoſtolical deſcent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, (and the chief of their Order,) were the chief and Prime Governours of this Church, by right; for the firſt Biſhops are certainly known to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles themſelves, as <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. And the Magiſtrate, while Heathen, had no right to controle them, in any part of their Commiſſion, that was from Chriſt, for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Goſpel, or the publick weal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Church, in truth, and order, and regular Communion, in this world; therefore, in that reſpect alone, they were <hi>exempt,</hi> and not ſubject to any human Laws and Authorities whatſoever; which liberty hath been <hi>ſcandalouſly</hi> abus'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the principles of Popery, to exemption from <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates:</hi> As if <hi>they</hi> had been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>oppoſite,</hi> and <hi>aſymbolical</hi> with the Goſpel, as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> But when the Magiſtrate became Chriſtian, in <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine, &amp;c.</hi> And were received into the Church, (according to their quality, and ſtation before in the World, of Gods Erection,) the Caſe was otherwiſe again; for now they were <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtial Magiſtrates,</hi> as well as <hi>Civil;</hi> and if <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> therefore <hi>Supream</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> cauſes,

Therefore, as the Supremacy of the Church was <hi>Originally</hi> in our <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops, ſo it came afterwards <hi>Eminently,</hi> to be lodged and veſted of right, in our <hi>Brittiſh Chriſtian Magiſtrates;</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Biſhops giving place to Chriſtian Kings, like the leſſer to the greater Luſtre; who yet acted little or nothing without their advice, and counſel, as we found King <hi>Arthur,</hi> a little before, chuſing his Biſhops and Archbiſhops with the advice of Synods. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as we ſay, where the King is, there the Court is; ſo it may, as well, be ſaid and juſtified, where the Chriſtian King of <hi>Brittain</hi> is, there is the Primate of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and head of this Church: Notwithſtanding, as our Kings in their Civil Capacities, have their <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Courts, and Tribunalls for <hi>Habitation,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by Law and cuſtome, as well as <hi>Ambulatory</hi> and Perſonal; ſo likewiſe in their Eccleſiaſtical, their <hi>ſtanding Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macyes,</hi> where they pleaſed by Law to fix them, as did King <hi>Lucius</hi> perhaps at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> at <hi>Caerleon,</hi> and others at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> which they, or their Succeſſors, may adjourn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move elſewhere, in like manner, when they ſee good reaſon.

               <p>The next ſhall be that known, and famous Canon, touching the ſeveral limits and Perambulations of the Ancient Chayrs of <hi>Alexandria, Rome,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and other Metropolitan Sees, in the Ancient Church, (being the Rule, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereon the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> grounded their Decree and preſident;) that all might know their own Limits, and enjoy their own rights, and keep within their own bounds, <gap reason="foreign">

For this were to be blowen up with a deſire of wordly greatneſs, as before.

Nor is it enough with Popes, to be the firſt in the ſame rank and order, [which once they had, while the City was Imperial, as there is a Priority or Seniority amongſt Dukes, and Grandees, for peace and order ſake) but they muſt have all their <hi>Equals,</hi> to be their <hi>Subjects;</hi> and the <hi>whole World</hi> but <hi>one Province,</hi> and that Subject to them alone; and until all be their own, Peace and Order, muſt not be.

A Soul ſubject to man, more than God, is no Soul; as are all ſuch, who by force, or choice, are to obey man againſt the Truth: Wherein, (as was proved at firſt) the maſter-errour of Popery did conſiſt: Men of depos'd Souls, or ſilenc'd Conſciences, in Scripture account, are beaſts: But the other part of the character, or a profeſſion of Holineſs and zeal, <hi>included,</hi> as well as good Conſcience <hi>excluded,</hi> is ſet forth by the other notes, <hi>Hornes like a Lamb, and Speech like a Dragon:</hi> That is, this beaſt, is as Chriſt, for arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Holineſs, and authority; and yet as Satan, or the Dragon, or Serpent in Paradice, for deſtructive ſeduction.

Now how can thoſe be true Chriſtians, who are not men? and how men, who want Souls? for where is the Soul, if it be given away from Chriſt, to any mortal whatſoever? For the hearts and judgements, that is, the Souls, of Papiſts are abſolutely ſubject to the Pope, but of Proteſtants, only to Chriſt, and truth; the one are holy from the heart to Chriſt, as Chriſts ſervants: the other, without a heart, to their Pope, or guide, as the Servants of men.</p>

And that none are greater Hereticks in Truth and reality, than themſelves; and of their Title <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> which they ſo well like: And Old <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Brittain,</hi> both Heathen, and Chriſtian, compar'd with the <hi>Modern:</hi> And that the yoak of <hi>Rome</hi> is not better to us, than our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</head>
               <p>BY their condemning Proteſtants, ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Hereticks, becauſe they believe not after the manifeſt errours of their ſingle Church, though they profeſs to believe after Chriſt, and his Scriptures, and his true and pureſt Catholick Church, they do but <hi>call</hi> others ſuch, what <hi>they</hi> make, and convict themſelves to <hi>be</hi> thereby: It hath been ever the Cuſtom, or craft of men, when ſin, or Satan, or any vile deſign hath poſſeſs'd the Throne of their heart, inſtead of Chriſt, to imploy his Name, and Laws, and Power, againſt, not the enemies of Chriſt and the truth, but the oppoſers of that luſt, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, which ſucceeds him. Upon which ſcore the Sobereſt and Holieſt Proteſtants, (though Catholicks with God,) are Hereticks with the Pope, for oppoſing his Chriſt; that is, his Carnal Will, and Grandeur, which rules his heart inſtead of its right Soveraign. For if Chriſt, and his mind, did
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:41014:267"/>
reign therein, ſuch Hereticks, as right Proteſtants are, would ſoon be embrac'd for Chriſtian Brethren. And he that judges of Hereſie contrary to Chriſts mind and will, finds the firſt Heretick in himſelf. The right method heretofore, to judge of Hereſie, was the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> for a rule, and holy <hi>Churche's Authority,</hi> proceeding by ſuch a rule; or <hi>Scriptura animatae,</hi> or Chriſt himſelf, ſpeaking in men: But with ſome now a dayes, <hi>one</hi> mans abſolute will and pleaſure, and his worldly concerns and acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="a" place="bottom">Haereticus arguitur, qui monitus non reſtituit bona Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae, <hi>Spondan</hi> Anno <hi>794.</hi> n. <hi>6.</hi>

There are ſeveral other Characteriſtical marks and effects, of the want and abſence of the heart, and conſcience, in the Romiſh Religion, wherein it goes beyond common Hereſies, and bids fair for Antichriſt. And waving the Principal, or <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like-<hi>Pride,</hi> the womb of Antichriſt, and Univerſal Supremacy according to our Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> which hath been our game and Subject all along, I ſhall inſtance, but in three or four genuine properties; very particular to that Church, above any other. 1. Its Addiction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in fictions and pious frauds, and officious lies and equivocations, and mental Reſervations, and Stolid, Inſipid Legends, and Infamous unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable forgeries, and falfifying of the Living, and the dead; both perſons, and Records, and Hiſtories, Fathers, Councils, Saints, Apoſtles, Angels, Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf; as well when there is no need of ſuch Arts, as when there is; out of meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this ugly ſin, as it were to keep their hands
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:41014:270"/>
in; whereby few Eccleſiaſtical Authors, ſaving the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have eſcaped their forgeries; and their Hiſtories, (where they are worth the reading,) are ſcarce to be believed, but where they ſpeak againſt them, and their Intereſt: now a lye, is a ſlight, or repugnancy to the heart, and to God preſent in it; or to <hi>Ciceroe's</hi> Divine mind, and by conſequence never without a kind of perjury, in its train. But when the heart is with Chriſt, Chriſt is with that heart, by conſequence: and he that ſpeaks, with and from his heart, never lies for Chriſt ſpeaks through him, by fiction, and he in whom Chriſt ſpeaks, cannot lye; for Chriſt is Truth, and Truth is only that which God ſaith or approves. And God can neither lie himſelf, nor approve it in any others; where lyes are in common requeſt and vogue, it's a ſign, God, and the heart, are departed; and the Dialect of Satan, who is a lyar, becomes the Language of that Country. The Innundation of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and Fables, that over-ſpreads the ſervice, and Religion, and Profeſſion of that Church, manifeſtly proves, (that its banks are broken,) that there is little or nothing of the heart, or Chriſt, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, left amongſt them, as the ſole and proper walls and fences againſt all untruth and falſhood; for regard to the <hi>heart alone,</hi> will keep out lyes, as in Generous Heathens, and all perſons of true honour and honeſty; much more to the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as with all true Chriſtians: there is an Antipathy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency between every <hi>Ly,</hi> and Chriſt, and the heart, and Conſcience, and Honour. Where lying, and Legending, and diſſimulation before God and man, are eaſily diſpenſed with, as no where more than at <hi>Rome,</hi> there Chriſt, and the heart, are but caſhier'd Soveraigns, and ſtand for Ciphers; And in what Church, or Profeſſion ſoever, Chriſt goes off the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:41014:270"/>

Whereof the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Myſtery is retain'd and profeſs'd in the Academy of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the common practice and lying Dialect of his Kingdom, is to be met in other Apoſtatical places and Ages, co-diſpers'd with the Church, like Tares among Wheat, to deſtroy and choak it. And though the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Apoſtacy uſe different Dialects, the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> and the <hi>Latine,</hi> yet they underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and exactly agree in their common Mother Tongue of vain lying. For our <hi>Popiſh</hi> Legends, and <hi>Alcharon</hi> Dreams, and <hi>Talmudical</hi> Dotages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in differ they, but in the Garb and Maſquerade of different Languages? being all three, a breed of the ſame womb, and the Genuine off-ſpring of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lyes, ſtrongly retaining, as bred in the bone, the humour and ſpecial faculty, of vending their own Errours for Gods Truths, whoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters they pretend each to be, but the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> more eſpecially.</p>

Mercy therefore and mildneſs, and compaſſion from the heart, to erroneous fellow-Chriſtians, is a great demonſtration of true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtianity, where ever it occurres, or ſhines; as mercileſs hoſtilities, and zealous killing, and burning all Diſſenters, of the contrary; and of the Eclipſe of the heart, and Conſcience, and Chriſt by conſequence, in ſuch a Church, or Chriſtian.

For where Chriſt and the heart are excluded, (as in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church too much) naught but burning, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all diſſenters, as Hereticks, ſerves the turn, when it is within their power; and is never out of their Study, and Inclination, when it is not.

And what can be the cauſe of this Helliſh Inhumanity towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren, but the want and abſence of the heart and Conſcience, or which equally deſtroys it, the giving of it to the Pope inſtead of Chriſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Papiſt is of a piece with the Pope in all things, (which yet adds not one Cubit to his Stature, nor to his virtue, or Graces, or humanity, or Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but he is ſtill on Earth, as he was before) as a Chriſtian is <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt in Heaven, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker on Earth, of his meek, and gratious, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſpoſitions. It's another-gueſs perfection to be United to Chriſt, than to the Pope; which is the true difference between a Proteſtant and a Papiſt: the one puts on Chriſt, the other puts on the Pope, by their ſeveral reſignations, of their private Wills, and Judgements.

Chriſt, but for impunity from human Laws, or vain-glory, or ſome other ſecret end, and purpoſe of the mind; it is that end, we thereby ſerve, and not the Lord; and by our <hi>out-ſide,</hi> and the charitable eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of men, who are deceiveable, we may be true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or our ſouls (which truly are our ſelves,) will be found out of the Church of Chriſt, in Gods account, who Judges by the heart, and cannot be deceived. And this Church of Chriſt is in Heaven, where Chriſt is at Gods right hand, and men become of it by ſaith, and the ſincerity of the heart, (which alone can reach it) while in the body they remain on Earth. This is the true Catholick Church, (whoſe Silver <hi>Rome</hi> borrows to cover its Braſs with,) out of whoſe <hi>pale</hi> there can be no Salvation, nor Condemnation ever to any that are found within it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus.</hi> If a man were Excommunicated by <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and be of this Church, he were ſafe, being <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus in occulto,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtiles ſuch a one in his Book, <hi>de verá Religione cap.</hi> 6. and miſs of Salvation, though in the boſom of both Churches, if he be not in his heart, of this. A Chriſtian who is inwardly by his heart, in Heaven with Chriſt, Chriſt and Heaven are preſent to his heart by Conſequence; and ſuch a one is, as it were, Chriſt Incarnate, (as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who is out of Chriſt in his heart, and wedded to other ends, or Idols, is a Devil incarnate, more or leſs.) And this new Celeſtial perſon, which he puts on, becomes the ſtandard of his Intereſt, and the Rule of his deportment; whatſoever he doth agreable to Chriſt, thus in him, is his honour, and newſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and peace; and whatſoever unbecoming, the contrary. For <hi>Cicero</hi> would allow, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:41014:299"/>
we ſuſtain by nature, or by calling, (and by Grace by Conſequence) becomes the Rule, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men's duties, and obligations; ſo that there is a vaſt, and an infinite difference, between one in Chriſt, and out of Chriſt, between a Chriſtian and no Chriſtian, as much as between Heaven, and Earth, Fleſh and the Spirit, God and a Creature. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> reduces the whole, to this point: They only, that are in Chriſt, can be Juſtified, and Sanctified, and Saved, and no other: and their Natures are chang'd, and exalted by this conjunction; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all their Actions and affections; which anſwer to the nature, they ariſe from, as the fruit to the tree. And they that are out of Chriſt, are out of all hopes, and poſſibility of Juſtification, or Sanctification, or Salvation: and the old man, or Nature, continues in them, and the mortal incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and deeds thereof, by Conſequence. And this change of mens ſtate, in reſpect of dignity, as well as ſafety, to be freed from wrath, and made as ſecond Sons to God, is not from any human merit, or power; but only from the Infinite, and free grace of Chriſt. <hi>By whom we have acceſs by Faith, into this grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in hope of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. Rom.</hi> 5.2. Our Juſtification, and happineſs by this new ſtate, is attributed by the Scriptures, to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>Faith,</hi> and to his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> without us, as to the Purchaſer, and Founder, and Finiſher: To <hi>Faith</hi> within us, as to the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part Inſtrument of our acceptance, and the effectual appearance, and exiſtence of the Truth, and reality, of this high mercy, and its Obligations, in our minds and perſwaſions; for what is not known, or own'd and received in the ſoul, is, as was ſaid before, with all men of no account, as to them; no more, than if

Whether Chriſtian obedience, or a good life, be conditional to the Grace of the Goſpel? For anſwer; <hi>Eſſentially conſequent</hi> it is; but <hi>conditional,</hi> it can hardly be ſtil'd with any <hi>propriety.</hi> Its <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> to the being of a Chriſtian, to be Holy, Juſt, and Sober, and un-ſelfiſh: elſe he receives the Grace of God in vain, to his greater account, and guilt, than if he had ever been an Heathen, and without God. A vitious, unjuſt, unconſcionable Chriſtian, is an Inconſiſtency, or a contradiction; as much as a Valiant Coward, a chaſt Adulterer, an honeſt Cut-throat, a Loyal Rebel, a Trayterous Saint, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Fiend, <hi>Satan</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſhape, or <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Satan's</hi> diſpoſition; which is monſtrous Blaſphemy to imagine, yet the daily Blaſphemy of all Chriſtians, that live unanſwerably to their high Grace and Calling: But <hi>conditional,</hi> it ought not to be call'd for ſeveral reaſons. 1. Becauſe <hi>conditional</hi> is repugnant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of <hi>Grace,</hi> in its Nature, and end; what's conditional, is not Grace: what's Grace, is not conditional; eſpecially the Grace of Chriſt, which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuper-abounds all compariſon, and merit, or contract, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. The deſign of <hi>Grace,</hi> is to win the heart, and to ſwallow our beings, to become <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt; but the nature of <hi>condition,</hi> (which is Covenant,) ſuppoſes two, and them <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and to continue ſo aſunder, and ſo to undertake and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form each their part. 2. Hereby ſuppoſitions will be implyed, that are contrary to ſound Doctrine; for if Grace were <hi>conditional</hi> in ſuch manner, that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ever concurrent, and Indenting, and coevous with it; and neither ſet out, without the other; nor could Grace be exerted, without the condition were
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:41014:305"/>
the ſame time perform'd, either really, or by ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through belief and acceptation, which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. Now it's manifeſt, we did not love God, but he firſt loved us, when we were Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. and gave himſelf for us, that we might not periſh, but live; beſides, ſuch <hi>contemporary</hi> contract on mans part, to indent with, and anſwer Grace on God's part, ſuppoſes an <hi>Ability</hi> in <hi>human nature,</hi> before Grace, to undertake for it ſelf, to walk worthy of the Grace it ſhall receive; and is as abſurd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, as it were to Imagine, that God, before he would enter upon man's Creation, required the the duſt of the Earth, (whereof he was to be made) to enter into Articles, and promiſe, that it ſhould walk anſwerable to reaſon, after it were made into man, and received Gods breath into it; and that promiſe to be believ'd, and relyed on, and God to proceed to his Creation, upon that belief, (or performance in fiction) of the condition ſo inſiſted on. The <hi>Red Earth</hi> being as much qualified to paſs its word for human performance at mans firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as <hi>Corrupt nature,</hi> to paſs its word for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian performances, upon our Regeneration by Grace; which is the root, and venom of Pelagianiſm, if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> himſelf went ſo far. 3. It greatly ſoyles, and wrongs unworthily, the noble ſpring, and genuine clearneſs of Evangelical obedience; which muſt now begin to ariſe and proceed from Intereſt, and ſelf-ends within us, which before did ſpring from grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Gods grace without us, conſtraining us to give the whole glory to him, and leaving nothing to our ſelves to boaſt off: theſe two obediences dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from one another, as the obedience of a Servant, upon the ſcore of Salary and contract, which is neceſſary and ſervile, from the obedience of a child,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:41014:306"/>
upon the ſcore of duty, and nature, which is alſo neceſſary, but more Generous: or the mutual love between hearty friends, from that which is between Politicians to one another, both proceeding (as all our Actions do) from ſelf-preſervation; the one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and ſordid, the other (between true friends,) Tranſitive and Divine. The one loves himſelf in his Friend; where, by the mutual Tranſmigration of love, each conceives himſelf to be the other: The other loves his friend in himſelf, and for his own Immanent ends, that is, he loves himſelf, but not his friend. It is a great ſlavery and grievance, to be tyed up to Act towards God, upon low, and ſelfiſh Principles, when we may, and ought to move upon Generous and Tranſitive: to Act as children, (as it were) upon childiſh motives, when we may, and ought as men; to appear before a Prince in old Rags, when we may in good Apparrel. To have no other Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtian Heroes, but that they were chiefly guided by ſelf-intereſt; That St. <hi>Paul</hi> loved himſelf, as much, or more than Chriſt; or King <hi>Arthur</hi> his skin above his Church, and Country; than which, what greater Indignity can be offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It curtails the rewards of the other life, which will be ſcanter to thoſe, that were Religious for their own benefit, and Intereſt only; than to thoſe that acted out of thankfulneſs to their Redeemer, above any private ends whatſoever; for the one ſerv'd Chriſt, the other themſelves; the ends of the one was duty, and ſervice, more than reward; of the other, reward, and benefit, more than duty. The one ſhall have more in the end, of what was leſs in his Intention; the other no more by his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, than what he aim'd at.

For the Solution of this difficulty, and to contribute endeavours to reconcile the well meaning ſort of either ſide. Men are to be conſider'd and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, into ſeveral degrees and orders; into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, or Chriſtians, which differ in <hi>kind;</hi> and theſe again into Babes, or Perfect men in Chriſt, which differ but in <hi>degree;</hi> for all are either wholly ſelfiſh, and worldly, and Carnal, (as are all out of Chriſt,) or highly Spiritual, and ſelf-Annihilated, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, as are thoſe within the School of Chriſt, as are of the higheſt form therein; or of a mixt ſort between both, on the frontiers between the fleſh and ſpirit, an unpeaceable ſtation, ſubject by turnes to the inroads and prevalence of both, being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies to one another.

Grace is to be affirmed to be free and unconditional; and
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:41014:308"/>
not to depend upon human merit, and performance, which it infinitely ſurpaſſes, as well in point of time, as of love undeſerved: and that Divinity, which degenerates into a meer Moral Philoſophy, is to be ſuſpected, as unſound, and far ſhort of their Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, who aſſert, and maintain the free love, and Grace of God in Chriſt. The principles of the one, going no higher than immanent, and Carnal ſelf-preſervation, which the old man, and Heatheniſm could reach; the other, to tranſitive and Divine, proper to Chriſtians, or the new-man in Chriſt. 2. That Chriſtian <hi>edification,</hi> (which is to be heeded next after abſolute <hi>Truth,</hi>) is moſt with them, who attemper their Doctrines to the ſeveral maturities of their hearers; <hi>Being all things to all men, that they may gain ſome,</hi> convincing natural men with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, and thoſe that are Spiritual, <hi>with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit and Truth.</hi> For the glorious light of free grace, which drinks up the pure ſoul in gratitude, and redamation, is too ſtrong a luſtre for weak and Carnal eyes, enough to blind them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſecurity and libertiniſm; the ſoil being not fully fitted for this Heauenly ſeed, ſuch are better manur'd and prepar'd by rational culture, to become <hi>right men</hi> in the firſt place, to the end they may become <hi>right Chriſtians</hi> in the next; and their falſe health, and confidence to be caſt down, with the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their natural Diſeaſe, and danger, that their Cure, and their Phyſitian, may be rightly valued by them; the ſervile ſpirit of bondage is beſt tam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of War. Divinity, in the form of Philoſophy, may edifie Heathens, that are in the form of Chriſtians; but Chriſtians that are ſincere, and able to know Chriſt's voice from anothers, are ſcandaliz'd, and troubled at nothing more, than at the change of of their Goſpel, and the return of Heatheniſm: which is then intended, when the <hi>milk</hi> is maintain'd to be <hi>strong meat;</hi> and what ſerved for <hi>edification</hi> to <hi>ſome,</hi> is raiſed to be an <hi>abſolute</hi> Law of <hi>Truth,</hi> for <hi>all;</hi> and grace to give place to morality.

               <p>The third Queſtion is more Practical and to the point. What ſets the ſoul within the Church of Chriſt in Heaven, out of which, none can be ever ſaved, nor in it, ever loſt? A <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, if asked, will ſay, To be within the Pale of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to be ſubject to the Pope, and to believe as the Church believes, will do it; and nothing elſe without it. For let a man be never ſo vitious, and Ungodly, if he ſtick cloſe to their Church, (which is allowed to be conſiſtent, provided he have the Abſolution of a Prieſt, at the laſt gaſp upon his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and condition; (or if this be wanting) upon his attrition, or fear of Hell;) he ſhall not miſs Eternal Salvation, nor ever attain the ſame, if he be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> though never ſo holy, or charitable, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and believing; ſo are ſuch Caſuiſts, for their want of love to the truth, delivered over to deceive, both themſelves, and others. But to wave all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to give a plain and clear anſwer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth, (or the mind of God in his word, which is the ſame,) which the ſoul and Conſcience loves to believe, and build upon, before any human Authority whatſoever. This queſtion may be divided into two points, or Iſſues; <hi>Stricti juris, &amp; largi.</hi> 1. What that is, that makes one a Member of that Heavenly Church; which if he wants, he is none. 2.

According to the ſence of that Phraſe, it may be further anſwer'd, in <hi>three</hi> words. 1. To be Chriſt's and not his own. 2. to dye in his death to Earth: 3. to live in his life to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:41014:311"/>
1. To be Chriſt's, and not his own. <hi>All are yours, and ye are Chriſt's.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. and 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>Christ dyed for all, that none ſhould live unto themſelves.</hi> No Chriſtian is to live unto himſelf, but unto Chriſt. He is to eat, and drink, and converſe, and riſe, and lye down, and labour, and reſt, and ſtudy, and ſerve, and obey, and command, and rule, and to bring up, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for children, and relieve the poor, and poor friends, every thing, as to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as guided by his Law, and accountable to his Judicature. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be a Servant to another, that minds his own affairs, or pleaſure altogether, and never his Maſter's, but when himſelf pleaſes, for a ſpurt or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Neither is any ſelfiſh perſon a Servant of Chriſt, nor a true ſalvable Chriſtian by conſequence; but is one, that ſets up for himſelf; And is not under Chriſt's Law and will, but his own. Neither ſhall be under his pay, but muſt muſt expect his reward, and Salvation from himſelf, as he lived wholly to, and for himſelf; and his Conſcience cannot gain-ſay this Law; for ſuch a one never hath Communion with God, (as all true Chriſtians have) but only with himſelf, like a Rebel Mock-god, ordering all things in the World for his own ends; as God doth all, for his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and never durſt truſt God ſo far, as to go out of himſelf for his ſake: In himſelf ſhall he therefore ever remain, and out of Chriſt forever; becauſe he never had the honeſty, to give God his glory; nor the faith, to give his heart, that is himſelf to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. 2. To dye in Chriſts death, to the Pomp and vanity of the World; which according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s comment, is the myſtical Chriſtian meaning, and fulfilling of the Ancient Circumciſion. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14, 16.

               <p>But though none have properly this ſingular op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and Priviledge, of reſembling their Lord in ſuch a depth of love, and height of Glory, but thoſe alone; to whom it is given to be <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> in this preſent World: who have much wealth and greatneſs to quit and leave, for the relief of the Needy, as Chriſt did; great Parts to proſtrate, great State, and Dignity to undervalue, for Chriſt, and his poor Members. Yet every charitable Chriſtian hath this capacity and Priviledge in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> and in the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> though not in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and in the <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> for ſo the Widows mite was her Exinanition, and is, in proportion, of every liberall giver of a narrow Eſtate and Fortune, in our Saviours Book of Rates; wherein all mens Actions, and Perſons are Rated, and computed by the heart: And the true Church is a Kingdom of hearts; where all we do, is to be done <hi>from the heart, as unto the Lord;</hi> and he is in Heaven, whoſe heart is in Heaven; and with Chriſt at Gods right hand, whoſe heart is there with Chriſt, though he be on Earth in the fleſh. The Chriſtian begins to be in Heaven in this World, (waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond all the dangers of Fabulous Purgatory) when he begins to converſe entirely from his heart with Chriſt in Heaven; for, <hi>non ubi animat ſed ubi amat, there</hi> all men are, <hi>where</hi> there hearts are; their hearts, being with Chriſt, the men themſelves are by conſequence with him, whereſoever elſe they may be in their mortal Bodies. Heaven there begins, where this Chriſtian converſation begins, that <hi>leads</hi> to Heaven, and is <hi>already</hi> in it; as the Ocean in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, many be ſaid to begin, not at the Rivers mouth.

but from the firſt ſpring of the River, that Travels towards it; for means are the beginnings of thoſe ends, for which they ſerve, and ſimilar parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And every ſtep from our home, in the right way, is more or leſs, an entrance into our Journie's end.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian's firſt ſetting forth for Heaven, is like the beginning of a ſmall Rivulet, which many a time, a hot Summer, or ſharp Winter of temptation, wholy dries up, and ſtops; but recovering it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, by the Influence, and pity of Heaven, in Dew, and Rain; and falling in, with other Rivers, that ſpeed towards the ſame Sea, either they into it, or it into them, it grows bigger, and ſtronger, by the Communion; and drawing towards its latter end, and hoping to be diſembogued at laſt into its reſt; it finds it ſelf repell'd again, and again, with a kind violence, and an uſeful growth, and Sea-like large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſwelling, ſo that it becomes hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, where the River ends, or where the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; and being rewarded, and comforted for theſe frequent ſtops, and interruptions, with Divine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſts of that finall brackiſhneſs, into which it is to be in the end diſſolv'd, and ſeaſon'd with; its inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received, and admitted into its reſt at laſt; and then, and there, <hi>lost</hi> forever, and <hi>found</hi> forever, in the Boſom of the Immenſe Ocean: ſo is it, moſt an end, with every Chriſtian ſoul, at the beginning, and progreſs, and end of his Chriſtian Race; who is as ſure to reach to his reſt, and glory, in the boſom of God forever, as Rivers to reach the Sea: which they are reaching every day, nearer, and nearer, as they move towards it, in the channel, that leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and is the very ſame Element with it.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if all could be perſwaded, and won to walk up to this ſhort and Catholick Rule, which
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:41014:317"/>
reaches all Nations, and Churches, and Conditions, and Vocations, and degrees, to diſcharge all their duties to one another from the heart, as unto Chriſt; there would be more truth, and veracity in the World, not only towards Brethren, but towards enemies, and ſtrangers, who have Chriſt in mens hearts to hold, in their behalf, any promiſe pawn'd, and made unto them; the violation whereof carries as much of Atheiſm, and contempt of Chriſt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> the heart, as diſhoneſty <hi>without,</hi> towards him, it wrongs: There would be more meekneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards enemies, and perſecutors, if not for their ſakes, yet for Chriſts, who commands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and love to enemies, More obedience, or ſubmiſſion, to all Governours, to the <hi>beſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> and their <hi>own;</hi> to the worſt, for <hi>Chriſt ſake</hi> however, being our <hi>neceſſary</hi> duty, and their due Almes. There would be more love, and readineſs to help one another by Counſel, or Purſe, or Prayer, inſtead of eating, and devouring one another by Craft and Power; when it ſhall be conſider'd, that every benefit, or wrong, we do to our Neighbour <hi>without,</hi> we do both, in a higher degree, and greater edge, to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>within</hi> our hearts, to our Eternal reward, or reckoning. This would make men true Chriſtians, and Loyal Subjects, and tender Fathers and Governours, and juſt Maſters, and right members in their reſpective Communities and Societies, and truſts; and Genuine Sons of the Church, not only of <hi>England,</hi> our Mother on Earth, but of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, the Mother of us all in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the ſaving of our Souls Infallibly, when the whole ſtock of Mountebank Indulgencies ſhall faile to effect the Cure.

Heaven and Earth in Tune again, and God at peace with his Creatures; and plant joy, and concord, and the peace of God, (which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,) in every Kingdom, in every City, in every Family, in every Breaſt. And that Angelical Prophetical Anthem at our Saviours Birth, would recover its Truth and Power in the World; <hi>And Glory ſhould be to God on high, and on Earth peace, and good will towards men.</hi>
